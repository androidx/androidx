/**
 * Manages user authentication flows.
 *
 * An application can call the CredentialManager apis to launch framework UI flows for a user to
 * register a new credential or to consent to a saved credential from supported credential
 * providers, which can then be used to authenticate to the app.
 *
 * This class contains its own exception types.
 * They represent unique failures during the Credential Manager flow. As required, they
 * can be extended for unique types containing new and unique versions of the exception - either
 * with new 'exception types' (same credential class, different exceptions), or inner subclasses
 * and their exception types (a subclass credential class and all their exception types).
 *
 * For example, if there is an UNKNOWN exception type, assuming the base Exception is
 * [ClearCredentialException], we can add an 'exception type' class for it as follows:
 * ```
 * class ClearCredentialUnknownException(
 *     errorMessage: CharSequence? = null
 * ) : ClearCredentialException(TYPE_CLEAR_CREDENTIAL_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION, errorMessage) {
 *  // ...Any required impl here...//
 *  companion object {
 *       private const val TYPE_CLEAR_CREDENTIAL_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION: String =
 *       "androidx.credentials.TYPE_CLEAR_CREDENTIAL_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Furthermore, the base class can be subclassed to a new more specific credential type, which
 * then can further be subclassed into individual exception types. The first is an example of a
 * 'inner credential type exception', and the next is a 'exception type' of this subclass exception.
 *
 * ```
 * class UniqueCredentialBasedOnClearCredentialException(
 *     type: String,
 *     errorMessage: CharSequence? = null
 * ) : ClearCredentialException(type, errorMessage) {
 *  // ... Any required impl here...//
 * }
 * // .... code and logic .... //
 * class UniqueCredentialBasedOnClearCredentialUnknownException(
 *     errorMessage: CharSequence? = null
 * ) : ClearCredentialException(TYPE_UNIQUE_CREDENTIAL_BASED_ON_CLEAR_CREDENTIAL_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION,
 * errorMessage) {
 * // ... Any required impl here ... //
 *  companion object {
 *       private const val
 *       TYPE_UNIQUE_CREDENTIAL_BASED_ON_CLEAR_CREDENTIAL_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION: String =
 *       "androidx.credentials.TYPE_CLEAR_CREDENTIAL_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
