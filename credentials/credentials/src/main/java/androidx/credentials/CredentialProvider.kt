/**
 * Provider interface to be implemented by system credential providers that
 * will fulfill Credential Manager requests. The implementation **must** have a constructor that
 * takes in a context.
 *
 * <p>Note that for SDK version 33 and below, this interface can be implemented by any OEM
 * provider that wishes to return credentials. The implementation must have a constructor with a
 * context parameter. A provider must :
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Release a dedicated provider library that developers can add as a dependency.
 *     <li>Include an empty CredentialProviderService in the provider library for the purposes of
 *     exposing a meta-data tag in the Android Manifest file.
 *     <li>Add the name of the class that is implementing this interface, as a value
 *     to the meta-data tag described above.
 *     <li>Make sure that there is only one provider implementation on the device. If the device
 *     already has a provider installed, and the developer specifies more than one provider
 *     dependencies, credential manager will error out.
 *</ol>
 *
 * <p>For SDK version 34 and above, this interface will only be implemented by an internal
 * class that will route all requests to the android framework. Providers will need
 * to register directly with the framework to provide credentials.
