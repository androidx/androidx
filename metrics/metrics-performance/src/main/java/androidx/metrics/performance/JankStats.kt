/**
 * This class is used to both accumulate and report information about UI "jank" (runtime
 * performance problems) in an application.
 *
 * There are three major components at work in JankStats:
 *
 * **Identifying Jank**: This library uses internal heuristics to determine when
 * jank has occurred, and uses that information to know when to issue jank reports so
 * that developers have information on those problems to help analyze and fix the issues.
 *
 * **Providing UI Context**: To make the jank reports more useful and actionable,
 * the system provides a mechanism to help track the current state of the UI and user.
 * This information is provided whenever reports are logged, so that developers can
 * understand not only when problems occurred, but what the user was doing at the time,
 * to help identify problem areas in the application that can then be addressed. Some
 * of this state is provided automatically, and internally, by various AndroidX libraries.
 * But developers are encouraged to provide their own app-specific state as well. See
 * [PerformanceMetricsState] for more information on logging this state information.
 *
 * **Reporting Results**: On every frame, the JankStats client is notified via a listener
 * with information about that frame, including how long the frame took to
 * complete, whether it was considered jank, and what the UI context was during that frame.
 * Clients are encouraged to aggregate and upload the data as they see fit for analysis that
 * can help debug overall performance problems.
 *
 * Note that the behavior of JankStats varies according to API level, because it is dependent
 * upon underlying capabilities in the platform to determine frame timing information.
 * Below API level 16, JankStats does nothing, because there is no way to derive dependable
 * frame timing data. Starting at API level 16, JankStats uses rough frame timing information
 * that can at least provide estimates of how long frames should have taken, compared to how
 * long they actually took. Starting with API level 24, frame durations are more dependable,
 * using platform timing APIs that are available in that release. And starting in API level
 * 31, there is even more underlying platform information which helps provide more accurate
 * timing still. On all of these releases (starting with API level 16), the base functionality
 * of JankStats should at least provide useful information about performance problems, along
 * with the state of the application during those frames, but the timing data will be necessarily
 * more accurate for later releases, as described above.
