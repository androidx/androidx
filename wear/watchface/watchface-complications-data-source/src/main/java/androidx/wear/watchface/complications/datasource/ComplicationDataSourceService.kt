/**
 * Class for sources of complication data.
 *
 * A complication data source service must implement [onComplicationRequest] to respond to requests
 * for updates from the complication system.
 *
 * Manifest requirements:
 *
 * - The manifest declaration of this service must include an
 * intent filter for android.support.wearable.complications.ACTION_COMPLICATION_UPDATE_REQUEST.
 *
 * - A ComplicationDataSourceService must include a `meta-data` tag with
 * android.support.wearable.complications.SUPPORTED_TYPES in its manifest entry. The value of this
 * tag should be a comma separated list of types supported by the data source. Types should be given
 * as named as per the type fields in the [ComplicationData], but omitting the "TYPE_" prefix, e.g.
 * `SHORT_TEXT`, `LONG_TEXT`, `RANGED_VALUE`.
 *
 * The order in which types are listed has no significance. In the case where a watch face
 * supports multiple types in a single complication slot, the watch face will determine which types
 * it prefers.
 *
 * For example, a complication data source that supports the RANGED_VALUE, SHORT_TEXT, and ICON
 * types would include the following in its manifest entry:
 *
 * ```
 * <meta-data android:name="android.support.wearable.complications.SUPPORTED_TYPES"
 * android:value="RANGED_VALUE,SHORT_TEXT,ICON"/>
 * ```
 *
 *
 * - A ComplicationDataSourceService should include a `meta-data` tag with
 * android.support.wearable.complications.UPDATE_PERIOD_SECONDS its manifest entry. The value of
 * this tag is the number of seconds the complication data source would like to elapse between
 * update requests.
 *
 * Note that update requests are not guaranteed to be sent with this frequency.
 *
 * If a complication data source never needs to receive update requests beyond the one sent when a
 * complication is activated, the value of this tag should be 0.
 *
 * For example, a complication data source that would like to update every ten minutes should
 * include the following in its manifest entry:
 *
 * ```
 * <meta-data android:name="android.support.wearable.complications.UPDATE_PERIOD_SECONDS"
 * android:value="600"/>
 * ```
 *
 * There is a lower limit for android.support.wearable.complications.UPDATE_PERIOD_SECONDS imposed
 * by the system to prevent excessive power drain. For complications with frequent updates they can
 * also register a separate SYNCHRONOUS_UPDATE_PERIOD_MILLISECONDS meta data tag which supports
 * sampling at up to 1Hz when the watch face is visible and non-ambient. This triggers
 * [onSynchronousComplicationRequest] requests.
 *
 * ```
 * <meta-data android:name=
 * "androidx.wear.watchface.complications.data.source.SYNCHRONOUS_UPDATE_PERIOD_MILLISECONDS"
 * android:value="1"/>
 * ```
 *
 * - A ComplicationDataSourceService can include a `meta-data` tag with
 * android.support.wearable.complications.PROVIDER_CONFIG_ACTION its manifest entry to cause a
 * configuration activity to be shown when the complication data source is selected.
 *
 * The configuration activity must reside in the same package as the complication data source, and
 * must register an intent filter for the action specified here, including
 * android.support.wearable.complications.category.PROVIDER_CONFIG as well as
 * [Intent.CATEGORY_DEFAULT] as categories.
 *
 * The complication id being configured will be included in the intent that starts the config
 * activity using the extra key android.support.wearable.complications.EXTRA_CONFIG_COMPLICATION_ID.
 *
 * The complication type that will be requested from the complication data source will also be
 * included, using the extra key android.support.wearable.complications
 * .EXTRA_CONFIG_COMPLICATION_TYPE.
 *
 * The complication data source's [ComponentName] will also be included in the intent that starts
 * the config activity, using the extra key
 * android.support.wearable.complications.EXTRA_CONFIG_PROVIDER_COMPONENT.
 *
 * The config activity must call [Activity.setResult] with either [Activity.RESULT_OK] or
 * [Activity.RESULT_CANCELED] before it is finished, to tell the system whether or not the
 * complication data source should be set on the given complication.
 *
 * - The manifest entry for the service should also include an android:icon attribute. The icon
 * provided there should be a single-color white icon that represents the complication data source.
 * This icon will be shown in the complication data source chooser interface, and may also be
 * included in [ComplicationProviderInfo] given to watch faces for display in their configuration
 * activities.
 *
 * - The manifest entry should also include
 * `android:permission="com.google.android.wearable.permission.BIND_COMPLICATION_PROVIDER"` to
 * ensure that only the system can bind to it.
 *
 * Multiple complication data sources in the same APK are supported but in android R there's a
 * soft limit of 100 data sources per APK. Above that the companion watchface editor won't
 * support this complication data source app.
