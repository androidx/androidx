/**
 * Node within a dynamic data pipeline.
 *
 * <p>Each node should either be a {@link DynamicDataSourceNode}, in which case it pushes data into
 * the pipeline, or it should expose one or more callbacks (generally instances of {@link
 * DynamicTypeValueReceiver}), which can be used by an upstream node to "push" data through the
 * pipeline. A node would typically look like the following:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * class IntToStringNode implements DynamicDataNode<String> {
 *   // The consumer on the downstream node to push data to.
 *   private final DynamicTypeValueReceiver<String> downstreamNode;
 *
 *   private final DynamicTypeValueReceiver<Integer> myNode =
 *     new DynamicTypeValueReceiver<Integer>() {
 *       @Override
 *       public void onPreUpdate() {
 *         // Don't need to do anything here; just relay.
 *         downstreamNode.onPreUpdate();
 *       }
 *
 *       @Override
 *       public void onData(Integer newData) {
 *         downstreamNode.onData(newData.toString());
 *       }
 *     };
 *
 *   public DynamicTypeValueReceiver<Integer> getConsumer() { return myNode; }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * An upstream node (i.e. one which yields an Integer) would then push data in to this node, via the
 * consumer returned from {@code IntToStringNode#getConsumer}.
 *
 * <p>Generally, node implementations will not use this interface directly; {@link
 * DynamicDataTransformNode} and {@link DynamicDataBiTransformNode} provide canonical
 * implementations for transforming data pushed from one or two source nodes, to a downstream node.
 *
 * @param <O> The data type that this node yields.
