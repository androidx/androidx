/**
 * Base level Wear Material [Card] that offers a single slot to take any content.
 *
 * Is used as the container for more opinionated [Card] components that take specific content such
 * as icons, images, titles, subtitles and labels.
 *
 * Cards can be enabled or disabled. A disabled card will not respond to click events.
 *
 * For more information, see the
 * [Cards](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/components/cards)
 * Wear OS Material design guide.
 *
 * @param onClick Will be called when the user clicks the card
 * @param modifier Modifier to be applied to the card
 * @param border A BorderStroke object which is used for the outline drawing.
 * Can be null - then outline will not be drawn
 * @param containerPainter A painter used to paint the background of the card. A card will
 * normally have a gradient background. Use [CardDefaults.cardBackgroundPainter()] to obtain an
 * appropriate painter
 * @param containerPainter A Painter which is used for background drawing.
 * @param enabled Controls the enabled state of the card. When false, this card will not
 * be clickable and there will be no ripple effect on click. Wear cards do not have any specific
 * elevation or alpha differences when not enabled - they are simply not clickable.
 * @param contentPadding The spacing values to apply internally between the container and the
 * content
 * @param shape Defines the card's shape. It is strongly recommended to use the default as this
 * shape is a key characteristic of the Wear Material Theme
 * @param interactionSource an optional hoisted [MutableInteractionSource] for observing and
 * emitting [Interaction]s for this card. You can use this to change the card's appearance
 * or preview the card in different states. Note that if `null` is provided, interactions will
 * still happen internally.
 * @param role The type of user interface element. Accessibility services might use this
 * to describe the element or do customizations
 * @param ripple Ripple used for this card
 * @param content A main slot for a content of this card

/**
 * Opinionated Wear Material [Card] that offers a specific 5 slot layout to show information about
 * an application, e.g. a notification. AppCards are designed to show interactive elements from
 * multiple applications. They will typically be used by the system UI, e.g. for showing a list of
 * notifications from different applications. However it could also be adapted by individual
 * application developers to show information about different parts of their application.
 *
 * The first row of the layout has three slots, 1) a small optional application [Image] or [Icon],
 * 2) an application name, it is expected to be a short start-aligned [Text] composable,
 * and 3) the optional time that the application activity has occurred which will be
 * shown on the top row of the card, this is expected to be an end aligned [Text] composable
 * showing a time relevant to the contents of the [Card].
 *
 * The second row shows a title, this is expected to be a single row of start aligned [Text].
 *
 * The rest of the [Card] contains the content which can be either [Text] or an [Image].
 * If the content is text it can be single or multiple line and is expected to be Top and Start
 * aligned.
 *
 * If more than one composable is provided in the content slot it is the responsibility of the
 * caller to determine how to layout the contents, e.g. provide either a row or a column.
 *
 * For more information, see the
 * [Cards](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/components/cards)
 * guide.
