/**
 * [ScreenScaffold] is one of the Wear Material3 scaffold components.
 *
 * The scaffold components [AppScaffold] and [ScreenScaffold] lay out the structure of a screen and
 * coordinate transitions of the [ScrollIndicator] and [TimeText] components.
 *
 * [ScreenScaffold] displays the [ScrollIndicator] at the center-end of the screen by default and
 * coordinates showing/hiding [TimeText] and [ScrollIndicator] according to [scrollState].
 *
 * This version of [ScreenScaffold] has a special slot for a button at the bottom, that grows and
 * shrinks to take the available space after the scrollable content.
 *
 * Example of using AppScaffold and ScreenScaffold:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.ScaffoldSample
 * @param scrollState The scroll state for [ScalingLazyColumn], used to drive screen transitions
 *   such as [TimeText] scroll away and showing/hiding [ScrollIndicator].
 * @param modifier The modifier for the screen scaffold.
 * @param timeText Time text (both time and potentially status message) for this screen, if
 *   different to the time text at the [AppScaffold] level. When null, the time text from the
 *   [AppScaffold] is displayed for this screen.
 * @param scrollIndicator The [ScrollIndicator] to display on this screen, which is expected to be
 *   aligned to Center-End. It is recommended to use the Material3 [ScrollIndicator] which is
 *   provided by default. No scroll indicator is displayed if null is passed.
 * @param bottomButton Optional slot for a Button (usually an [EdgeButton]) that takes the available
 *   space below a scrolling list. It will scale up and fade in when the user scrolls to the end of
 *   the list, and scale down and fade out as the user scrolls up.
 * @param content The body content for this screen.
