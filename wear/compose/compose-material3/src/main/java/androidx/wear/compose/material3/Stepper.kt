/**
 * [Stepper] allows users to make a selection from a range of values.
 * It's a full-screen control with increase button on the top, decrease button on the bottom and
 * a slot (expected to have either [Text] or [Button]) in the middle.
 * Value can be increased and decreased by clicking on the increase and decrease buttons.
 * Buttons can have custom icons - [decreaseIcon] and [increaseIcon].
 * Step value is calculated as the difference between min and max values divided by [steps]+1.
 * Stepper itself doesn't show the current value but can be displayed via the content slot or
 * [PositionIndicator] if required.
 * If [value] is not equal to any step value, then it will be coerced to the closest step value.
 * However, the [value] itself will not be changed and [onValueChange] in this case will
 * not be triggered.
 * To add range semantics on Stepper, use [Modifier.rangeSemantics].
 *
 * Example of a simple [Stepper]:
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.StepperSample
 *
 * Example of a [Stepper] with range semantics:
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.StepperWithRangeSemanticsSample
 *
 * @param value Current value of the Stepper. If outside of [valueRange] provided, value will be
 * coerced to this range.
 * @param onValueChange Lambda in which value should be updated
 * @param steps Specifies the number of discrete values, excluding min and max values, evenly
 * distributed across the whole value range. Must not be negative. If 0, stepper will have only
 * min and max values and no steps in between
 * @param decreaseIcon A slot for an icon which is placed on the decrease (bottom) button
 * @param increaseIcon A slot for an icon which is placed on the increase (top) button
 * @param modifier Modifiers for the Stepper layout
 * @param valueRange Range of values that Stepper value can take. Passed [value] will be coerced to
 * this range
 * @param backgroundColor [Color] representing the background color for the stepper.
 * @param contentColor [Color] representing the color for [content] in the middle.
 * @param iconColor Icon tint [Color] which used by [increaseIcon] and [decreaseIcon]
 * that defaults to [contentColor], unless specifically overridden.
 * @param content Content body for the Stepper.

 * Example of a [Stepper] with integer values:
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.StepperWithIntegerSample
 *
 * A number of steps is calculated as the difference between max and min values of
 * [valueProgression] divided by [valueProgression].step - 1.
 * For example, with a range of 100..120 and a step 5,
 * number of steps will be (120-100)/ 5 - 1 = 3. Steps are 100(first), 105, 110, 115, 120(last)
 *
 * If [valueProgression] range is not equally divisible by [valueProgression].step,
 * then [valueProgression].last will be adjusted to the closest divisible value in the range.
 * For example, 1..13 range and a step = 5, steps will be 1(first) , 6 , 11(last)
 *
 * If [value] is not equal to any step value, then it will be coerced to the closest step value.
 * However, the [value] itself will not be changed and [onValueChange] in this case will

 * @param value Current value of the Stepper. If outside of [valueProgression] provided, value will be

 * @param onValueChange Lambda in which value should be updated
 * @param valueProgression Progression of values that Stepper value can take. Consists of
 * rangeStart, rangeEnd and step. Range will be equally divided by step size
 * @param decreaseIcon A slot for an icon which is placed on the decrease (bottom) button
