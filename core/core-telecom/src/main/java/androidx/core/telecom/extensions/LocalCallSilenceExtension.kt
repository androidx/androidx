 * silence) instead of the hardware layer (global silence). Using a local call silence over global
 * silence is advantageous when the application wants to still receive the audio input data while
 * not transmitting audio input data to remote users. This allows applications to do stuff like
 * nudge the user when they are silenced but talking into the microphone.
