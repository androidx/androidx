     * barriers into the {@link Looper}'s message queue to prevent subsequent messages
     * from being delivered until some condition is met.  In the case of view invalidation,
     * messages which are posted after a call to {@link View#invalidate}
     * are suspended by means of a synchronization barrier until the next frame is
     * ready to be drawn.  The synchronization barrier ensures that the invalidation
     * request is completely handled before resuming.
     * <p>
     * Asynchronous messages are exempt from synchronization barriers.  They typically
     * represent interrupts, input events, and other signals that must be handled independently
     * even while other work has been suspended.
     * <p>
     * Note that asynchronous messages may be delivered out of order with respect to
     * synchronous messages although they are always delivered in order among themselves.
     * If the relative order of these messages matters then they probably should not be
     * asynchronous in the first place.  Use with caution.
