     * react to user actions, do not draw any content, and do not have any special
     * semantics in the context of the screen content. For example, a three by three
     * grid can be implemented as three horizontal linear layouts and one vertical,
     * or three vertical linear layouts and one horizontal, or one grid layout, etc.
     * In this context the actual layout mangers used to achieve the grid configuration
     * are not important, rather it is important that there are nine evenly distributed
