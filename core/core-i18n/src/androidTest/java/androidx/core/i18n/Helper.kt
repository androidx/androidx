     * This method changes all instances of U+202F to U+0020.
     *
     * Android U takes ICU 71.1, which uses NNBSP (NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE, U+202F)
     * between time and day cycle (for example 9:42\u202FPM)
     *
     * The Android `java.text.DateFormat` was patched to not use nnbsp (U+202F)
     * in Android U, but ICU still returns times with U+202F.
     * So this would give different results, but it is expected.
     * In time this will probably go away (as the newer Android images propagate everywhere).
     *
     * And, since the patch happened without changing the Android version (pre-release),
     * there are some Android U images that use space and some that use NNBSP.
     * So testing the version is not enough to reliably tell if we will get.
