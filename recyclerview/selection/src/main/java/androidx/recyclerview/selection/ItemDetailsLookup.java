     * An ItemDetails implementation provides the selection library with access to information

     * the behaviors of the selection library in the context of a specific activity.
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>Selection Hotspot</b>
     *
     * <p>
     * This is an optional feature identifying an area within a view that
     * is single-tap to select. Ordinarily a single tap on an item when there is no
     * existing selection will result in that item being activated. If the tap
     * occurs within the "selection hotspot" the item will instead be selected.
     *
     * <p>
     * See {@link OnItemActivatedListener} for details on handling item activation.
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>Drag Region</b>
     *
     * <p>
     * The selection library provides support for mouse driven band selection. The "lasso"
     * typically associated with mouse selection can be started only in an empty
     * area of the RecyclerView (an area where the item position == RecyclerView#NO_POSITION,
     * or where RecyclerView#findChildViewUnder returns null). But in many instances
     * the item views presented by RecyclerView will contain areas that may be perceived
     * by the user as being empty. The user may expect to be able to initiate band
     * selection in these empty areas.
     *
     * <p>
     * The "drag region" concept exists in large part to accommodate this user expectation.
     * Drag region is the content in an item view that the user doesn't otherwise
     * perceive to be empty or part of the background of recycler view.
     *
     * Take for example a traditional single column layout where
     * the view layout width is "match_parent":
     * <pre>
     * -------------------------------------------------------
     * | [icon]  A string label.   ...empty space...         |
     * -------------------------------------------------------
     *   < ---  drag region  --> < --treated as background-->
     *</pre>
     *
     * <p>
     * Further more, within a drag region, a mouse click and drag will immediately
     * initiate drag and drop (if supported by your configuration).
     *
     * <p>
     * As user expectations around touch and mouse input differ substantially,
     * "drag region" has no effect on handling of touch input.
     *
     * @param <K> Selection key type. @see {@link StorageStrategy} for supported types.

         * Mouse driven band selection operations are only ever initiated in non-drag-regions.
         * This is a consideration as many layouts may not include empty space between
         * RecyclerView items where band selection can be initiated.
         *
         * <p>
         * For example. You may present a single column list of contact names in a

         * available space.
         * But within the expanded view item after the contact name there may be empty space that a
