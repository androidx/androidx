 * of this class as a field at construction. For each <code>ViewGroup</code> method that has
 * a matching method signature in this class, delegate the operation to the helper instance
 * in an overriden method implementation. This implements the standard framework policy
 * for nested scrolling.</p>
 *
 * <p>Views invoking nested scrolling functionality should always do so from the relevant
 * {@link ViewCompat}, {@link ViewGroupCompat} or {@link ViewParentCompat} compatibility
 * shim static methods. This ensures interoperability with nested scrolling views on Android
 * 5.0 Lollipop and newer.</p>
