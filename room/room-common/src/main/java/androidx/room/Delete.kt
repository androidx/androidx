/**
 * Marks a method in a [Dao] annotated class as a delete method.
 *
 * The implementation of the method will delete its parameters from the database.
 *
 * All of the parameters of the Delete method must either be classes annotated with [Entity]
 * or collections/array of it.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * @Dao
 * public interface MusicDao {
 *     @Delete
 *     public fun deleteSongs(vararg songs: Song)
 *
 *     @Delete
 *     public fun deleteAlbumAndSongs(album: Album, songs: List<Song>)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If the target entity is specified via [entity] then the parameters can be of arbitrary
 * POJO types that will be interpreted as partial entities. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * @Entity
 * data class Playlist (
 *     @PrimaryKey
 *     val playlistId: Long,
 *     val ownerId: Long,
 *     val name: String,
 *     @ColumnInfo(defaultValue = "normal")
 *     val category: String
 * )
 *
 * data class OwnerIdAndCategory (
 *     val ownerId: Long,
 *     val category: String
 * )
 *
 * @Dao
 * public interface PlaylistDao {
 *     @Delete(entity = Playlist::class)
 *     fun deleteByOwnerIdAndCategory(varargs idCategory: OwnerIdAndCategory)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see Insert
 * @see Update

     * must contain a subset of the fields of the target entity. The fields value will be used to
