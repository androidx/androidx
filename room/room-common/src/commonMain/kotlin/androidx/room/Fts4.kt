/**
 * Marks an [Entity] annotated class as a FTS4 entity. This class will have a mapping SQLite
 * FTS4 table in the database.
 *
 * [FTS3 and FTS4] (https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html) are SQLite virtual table modules
 * that allows full-text searches to be performed on a set of documents.
 *
 * An FTS entity table always has a column named `rowid` that is the equivalent of an
 * `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` index. Therefore, an FTS entity can only have a single field
 * annotated with [PrimaryKey], it must be named `rowid` and must be of
 * `INTEGER` affinity. The field can be optionally omitted in the class but can still be
 * used in queries.
 *
 * All fields in an FTS entity are of `TEXT` affinity, except the for the 'rowid' and
 * 'languageid' fields.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * @Entity
 * @Fts4
 * data class Mail (
 *   @PrimaryKey
 *   @ColumnInfo(name = "rowid")
 *   val rowId: Int,
 *   val subject: String,
 *   val body: String
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * @see [Entity]
 * @see [Dao]
 * @see [Database]
 * @see [PrimaryKey]
 * @see [ColumnInfo]
