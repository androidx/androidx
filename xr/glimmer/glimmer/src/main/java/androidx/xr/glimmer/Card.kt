/**
 * Card is a component used to group related information into a single digestible unit. A card can
 * adapt to display a wide range of content, from simple text blurbs to more complex summaries with
 * multiple elements. A card contains text [content], and may also have any combination of [title],
 * [subtitle], [leadingIcon], and [trailingIcon]. If specified, [title] is placed on top of the
 * [subtitle], which is placed on top of the [content]. A card fills the maximum width available by
 * default.
 *
 * This Card is focusable - see the other [Card] overload for a clickable Card.
 *
 * See [ActionCard] for a card with a primary action, and [ImageCard] for a card with an image.
 *
 * Cards can also be combined with a [TitleChip]. See the documentation for [TitleChip] for more
 * information / sample code.
 *
 * A simple Card with just text:
 *
 * @sample androidx.xr.glimmer.samples.CardSample
 *
 * A Card with a trailing icon:
 *
 * @sample androidx.xr.glimmer.samples.CardWithTrailingIconSample
 *
 * A Card with a title, subtitle, and a leading icon:
 *
 * @sample androidx.xr.glimmer.samples.CardWithTitleAndSubtitleAndLeadingIconSample
 * @param modifier the [Modifier] to be applied to this card
 * @param title optional title to be placed above [subtitle] and [content]
 * @param subtitle optional subtitle to be placed above [content], below [title]
 * @param leadingIcon optional leading icon to be placed before [content]. This is typically an
 *   [Icon] tinted with [contentColor] by default.
 * @param trailingIcon optional trailing icon to be placed after [content]. This is typically an
 *   [Icon] tinted with [contentColor] by default.
 * @param shape the [Shape] used to clip this card, and also used to draw the background and border
 * @param color background color of this card
 * @param contentColor content color used by components inside [content], [title], [subtitle],
 *   [leadingIcon], and [trailingIcon].
 * @param contentPadding the spacing values to apply internally between the container and the
 *   content. Note that there is additional padding applied around the content / text / icons inside
 *   a card, this only affects the outermost content padding.
 * @param interactionSource an optional hoisted [MutableInteractionSource] for observing and
 *   emitting Interactions for this card. You can use this to change the card's appearance or
 *   preview the card in different states. Note that if `null` is provided, interactions will still
 *   happen internally.
 * @param content the main content / body text to display inside this card. This is recommended to
 *   be limited to 10 lines of text.
