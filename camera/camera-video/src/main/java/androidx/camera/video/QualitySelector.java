/**
 * QualitySelector defines a desired quality setting that can be used to configure components
 * with quality setting requirements such as creating a
 * {@link Recorder.Builder#setQualitySelector(QualitySelector) Recorder}.
 *
 * <p>There are pre-defined quality constants that are universally used for video, such as
 * {@link Quality#SD}, {@link Quality#HD}, {@link Quality#FHD} and {@link Quality#UHD}, but
 * not all of them are supported on every device since each device has its own capabilities.
 * {@link #isQualitySupported(CameraInfo, Quality)} can be used to check whether a quality is
 * supported on the device or not and {@link #getResolution(CameraInfo, Quality)} can be used to get
 * the actual resolution defined in the device. Aside from checking the qualities one by one,
 * QualitySelector provides a more convenient way to select a quality. The typical usage of
 * selecting a single desired quality is:
 * <pre>{@code
 *   QualitySelector qualitySelector = QualitySelector.from(Quality.FHD);
 * }</pre>
 * or the usage of selecting a series of qualities by desired order:
 * <pre>{@code
 *   QualitySelector qualitySelector = QualitySelector.fromOrderedList(
 *           Arrays.asList(Quality.FHD, Quality.HD, Quality.HIGHEST)
 *   );
 * }</pre>
 * The recommended way is giving a guaranteed supported quality such as {@link Quality#LOWEST} or
 * {@link Quality#HIGHEST} in the end of the desired quality list, which ensures the
 * QualitySelector can always choose a supported quality. Another way to ensure a quality will be
 * selected when none of the desired qualities are supported is to use
 * {@link #fromOrderedList(List, FallbackStrategy)} with an open-ended fallback strategy such as
 * a fallback strategy from {@link FallbackStrategy#lowerQualityOrHigherThan(Quality)}:
 * <pre>{@code
 *   QualitySelector qualitySelector = QualitySelector.fromOrderedList(
 *           Arrays.asList(Quality.UHD, Quality.FHD),
 *           FallbackStrategy.lowerQualityOrHigherThan(Quality.FHD)
 *   );
 * }</pre>
 * If UHD and FHD are not supported on the device, QualitySelector will select the quality that
 * is closest to and lower than FHD. If no lower quality is supported, the quality that is
 * closest to and higher than FHD will be selected.
