/**
 * [CoroutineMutex] is a shared [Mutex] instance with extension functions to allow callers to lock
 * the mutex from a non-coroutine function, while ensuring that the locked execution block is
 * always suspended (Which avoids synchronously running code that should be executed on a different
 * thread). This guaranteed suspension, plus the additional extension functions to make it easier
 * to correctly lock and run suspending code from a non-suspending function, is the primary
 * difference from using a [Mutex] object directly.
 *
 * This should not be used to run long running operations, since the lock will be held for the
 * entire duration. In addition, kotlin [Mutex] objects are non-reentrant, unlike standard java
 * `synchronized` locks.
