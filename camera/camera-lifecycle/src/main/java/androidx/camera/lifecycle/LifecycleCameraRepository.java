/**
 * A repository of {@link LifecycleCamera} instances.
 *
 * <p> This repository maps each unique pair of {@link LifecycleOwner} and set of
 * {@link CameraInternal} to a single LifecycleCamera.
 *
 * <p> The repository ensures that a LifecycleCamera can be active only when there is any use
 * case bound on it. And, only a single LifecycleCamera is active at a time. A Lifecycle can
 * control multiple LifecycleCameras. For the LifecycleCameras controlled by a single Lifecycle,
 * only one LifecycleCamera among them can have use cases bound on it.
 *
 * <p> LifecycleCameras managed by the repository can be controlled by multiple Lifecycles. The
 * repository ensures that a Lifecycle can be active only when any LifecycleCamera controlled by
 * the Lifecycle has any use case bound on it. More than one Lifecycle can become ON_START at
 * the same time. Only a single Lifecycle can be active at a time so if a Lifecycle becomes ON_START
 * then it will take over as the current active Lifecycle. The original active Lifecycle will
 * become inactive but is kept in the active Lifecycle array. When the Lifecycle of the most
 * recently active camera stops then it will make sure that the next most recently started Lifecycle
 * becomes the active Lifecycle.
 *
 * <p> A LifecycleCamera associated with the repository can also be released from the repository.
 * When it is released, all UseCases bound to the LifecycleCamera will be unbound and the
 * LifecycleCamera will be released.
