/**
 * Detects scaling transformation gestures that interprets zooming events using the supplied
 * [MotionEvent]s.
 *
 * The [OnZoomGestureListener] callback will notify users when a particular
 * gesture event has occurred.
 *
 * This class should only be used with [MotionEvent]s reported via touch.
 *
 * To use this class to do pinch-to-zoom on the viewfinder:
 * - In the [OnZoomGestureListener.onZoom], get the [scaleFactor] and set it to
 * `CameraControl.setZoomRatio` if the factor is in the range of `ZoomState.getMinZoomRatio` and
 * `ZoomState.getMaxZoomRatio`. Then create an instance of the `ZoomGestureDetector` with the
 * [OnZoomGestureListener].
 * - In the [View.onTouchEvent], call [onTouchEvent] and pass the [MotionEvent] to the
 * `ZoomGestureDetector`.
