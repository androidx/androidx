/**
 * Advanced OEM contract for implementing Extensions. ImageCapture/Preview Extensions are both
 * implemented on this interface.
 *
 * <p>This advanced OEM contract empowers OEM to gain access to more Camera2 capability. This
 * includes: (1) Add custom surfaces with specific formats like YUV, RAW, RAW_DEPTH. (2) Access to
 * the capture request callbacks as well as all the images retrieved of various image formats. (3)
 * Able to triggers single or repeating request with the capabilities to specify target surfaces,
 * template id and parameters.
 *
 * <p>OEM needs to implement it with class name HdrAdvancedExtenderImpl for HDR,
 * NightAdvancedExtenderImpl for night mode, BeautyAdvancedExtenderImpl for beauty mode,
 * BokehAdvancedExtenderImpl for bokeh mode and AutoAdvancedExtenderImpl for auto mode.
 *
 * <p>OEMs are required to return true in
 * {@link ExtensionVersionImpl#isAdvancedExtenderImplemented()} in order to request CameraX to
 * use advanced extender over basic extender. OEM is okay to implement advanced
 * extender only Or basic extender only. However the caveat of advanced-only implementation is,
 * extensions will be unavailable on the apps using interfaces prior to 1.2.
 *
 * @since 1.2
