/**
 * Interface for creating Camera2 CameraCaptureSessions with extension enabled based on
 * advanced vendor implementation.
 *
 * <p><pre>
 * The flow of a extension session is shown below:
 * (1) {@link #initSession}: CameraX prepares streams configuration for creating
 *     CameraCaptureSession. Output surfaces for Preview, ImageCapture and ImageAnalysis are passed
 *     in and vendor is responsible for outputting the results to these surfaces.
 *
 * (2) {@link #onCaptureSessionStart}: It is called after CameraCaptureSession is configured.
 *     A {@link RequestProcessorImpl} is passed for vendor to send repeating requests and
 *     single requests.
 *
 * (3) {@link #startRepeating}:  CameraX will call this method to start the repeating request
 *     after CameraCaptureSession is called. Vendor should start the repeating request by
 *     {@link RequestProcessorImpl}. Vendor can also update the repeating request if needed later.
 *
 * (4) {@link #setParameters(Map)}: The passed parameters will be attached to the repeating request
 *     and single requests but vendor can choose to apply some of them only.
 *
 * (5) {@link #startCapture(CaptureCallback)}: It is called when apps want to
 *     start a multi-frame image capture.  {@link CaptureCallback} will be called
 *     to report the status and the output image will be written to the capture output surface
 *     specified in {@link #initSession}.
 *
 * (5) {@link #onCaptureSessionEnd}: It is called right BEFORE CameraCaptureSession.close() is
 *     called.
 *
 * (6) {@link #deInitSession}: called when CameraCaptureSession is closed.
 * </pre>
