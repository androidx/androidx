/**
 * Quirk that requires Preview surface is in front of the MediaCodec surface when creating a
 * CameraCaptureSession.
 *
 *  <p>As described in b/196755459, on some Samsung devices, create CameraCaptureSession will fail
 *  silently if the input surface list does not have a Preview surface in front of a MediaCodec
 *  surface.
 *
 *  <p>On Pixel 1, when the MediaCodec surface size is 3840x2160(UHD) and the input list for
 *  creating CameraCaptureSession does not have Preview surface in front of the MediaCodec
 *  surface and ImageCapture surface, Preview will have interlaced color lines after start
 *  recording. See b/205340278. MediaCodec surface resolutions for 1920x1080(FHD), 1280x720(HD)
 *  and 720x480(SD) do not have this issue. Not clearly know if there is another resolution will
 *  encounter this issue, but this quirk should be safe to apply regardless the video surface
 *  resolution since the workaround just sorts the surface list while creating CameraCaptureSession.
