/**
 * A set of requirements and priorities used to select a resolution for the {@link UseCase}.
 *
 * <p>The resolution selection mechanism is determined by the following three steps:
 * <ol>
 *     <li> Collect the supported output sizes and add them to the candidate resolution list.
 *     <li> Filter and sort the candidate resolution list according to the {@link Builder}
 *     resolution settings.
 *     <li> Consider all the resolution selector settings of bound {@link UseCase}s to find the
 *     resolution that best suits each {@link UseCase}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>For the first step, all supported resolution output sizes are added to the candidate
 * resolution list as the starting point.
 *
 * <p>ResolutionSelector provides the following function for applications to adjust the candidate
 * resolution settings.
 * <ul>
 *     <li> {@link Builder#setAllowedResolutionMode(int)}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For the second step, ResolutionSelector provides the following three functions for
 * applications to determine which resolution should be selected with higher priority.
 * <ul>
 *     <li> {@link Builder#setAspectRatioStrategy(AspectRatioStrategy)}
 *     <li> {@link Builder#setResolutionStrategy(ResolutionStrategy)}
 *     <li> {@link Builder#setResolutionFilter(ResolutionFilter)}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>CameraX sorts the collected sizes according to the specified aspect ratio and resolution
 * strategies. The aspect ratio strategy has precedence over the resolution strategy for sorting
 * the resolution candidate list. If applications specify a custom resolution filter, CameraX
 * passes the resulting sizes list, sorted by the specified aspect ratio and resolution
 * strategies, to the resolution filter to get the final desired list.
 *
 * <p>Different types of {@link UseCase}s might have their own default settings. You can see the
 * {@link UseCase} buildersâ€™ {@code setResolutionSelector()} function to know the details for each
 * type of {@link UseCase}.
 *
 * <p>In the third step, CameraX selects the final resolution for the {@link UseCase} based on the
 * camera device's hardware level, capabilities, and the bound {@link UseCase} combination.
 * Applications can check which resolution is finally selected by using the {@link UseCase}'s
 * {@code getResolutionInfo()} function.
 *
 * <p>Note that a ResolutionSelector with more restricted settings may result in that no
 * resolution can be selected to use. Applications will receive {@link IllegalArgumentException}
 * when binding the {@link UseCase}s with such kind of ResolutionSelector. Applications can
 * specify the {@link AspectRatioStrategy} and {@link ResolutionStrategy} with proper fallback
 * rules to avoid the {@link IllegalArgumentException} or try-catch it and show a proper message
 * to the end users.
 *
 * <p>When creating a ResolutionSelector instance, the
 * {@link AspectRatioStrategy#RATIO_4_3_FALLBACK_AUTO_STRATEGY} will be the default
 * {@link AspectRatioStrategy} if it is not set.
 * {@link ResolutionSelector#PREFER_CAPTURE_RATE_OVER_HIGHER_RESOLUTION} is the default allowed
 * resolution mode. However, if neither the {@link ResolutionStrategy} nor the
 * {@link ResolutionFilter} are set, there will be no default value specified.
