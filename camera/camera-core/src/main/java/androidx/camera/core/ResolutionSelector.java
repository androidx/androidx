/**
 * A set of requirements and priorities used to select a resolution for the use case.
 *
 * <p>The resolution selection mechanism is determined by the following three steps:
 * <ol>
 *     <li> Collect supported output sizes to the candidate resolution list
 *     <li> Determine the selecting priority of the candidate resolution list by the preference
 *     settings
 *     <li> Consider all the resolution selector settings of bound use cases to find the best
 *     resolution for each use case
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>For the first step, all supported resolution output sizes are put into the candidate
 * resolution list as the base in the beginning.
 *
 * <p>ResolutionSelector provides the following two functions for applications to adjust the
 * conditions of the candidate resolutions.
 * <ul>
 *     <li> {@link Builder#setMaxResolution(Size)}
 *     <li> {@link Builder#setHighResolutionEnabled(boolean)}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For the second step, ResolutionSelector provides the following three functions for
 * applications to determine which resolution has higher priority to be selected.
 * <ul>
 *     <li> {@link Builder#setPreferredResolution(Size)}
 *     <li> {@link Builder#setPreferredResolutionByViewSize(Size)}
 *     <li> {@link Builder#setPreferredAspectRatio(int)}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The resolution that exactly matches the preferred resolution is selected in first priority.
 * If the resolution can't be found, CameraX falls back to use the sizes of the preferred aspect
 * ratio. In this case, the preferred resolution is treated as the minimal bounding size to find
 * the best resolution.
 *
 * <p>Different types of use cases might have their own additional conditions. Please see the use
 * case config buildersâ€™ {@code setResolutionSelector()} function to know the condition details
 * for each type of use case.
 *
 * <p>For the third step, CameraX selects the final resolution for the use case based on the
 * camera device's hardware level, capabilities and the bound use case combination. Applications
 * can check which resolution is finally selected by using the use case's {@code
 * getResolutionInfo()} function.
