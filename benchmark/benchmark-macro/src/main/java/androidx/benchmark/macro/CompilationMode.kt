/**
 * Type of compilation to use for a Macrobenchmark.
 *
 * Every Macrobenchmark has compilation reset before running, so that previous runs do not interfere
 * with the next. This compilation mode dictates any pre-compilation that occurs before repeatedly
 * running the setup / measure blocks of the benchmark.
 *
 * If [SpeedProfile] is used, the following occur before measurement:
 * 1. Compilation is reset
 * 2. The setup / measure loop will be run a configurable number of profiling iterations to capture
 * a profile
 * 3. The app is compiled with `cmd package compile -f -m speed-profile <package>`
 *
 * * [None] skips steps 2 and 3 above.
 * * [BaselineProfile] has an alternate implementation of 2, where it installs profile information
 * bundled within the APK.
 * * [Speed] skips 2 (since it AOT compiles the full app), and uses `speed` instead of
 * `speed-profile` for 3.
 *
 * While some of these modes directly map to
 * [Android Runtime compilation modes](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/configure#compilation_options)
 * (which can be passed to
 * [`cmd compile`](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/jit-compiler#force-compilation-of-a-specific-package)),
 * there isn't a direct mapping.
