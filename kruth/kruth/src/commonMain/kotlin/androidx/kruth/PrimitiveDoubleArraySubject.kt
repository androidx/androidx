     * trivial changes such as replacing `(a + b) + c` with `a + (b + c)`, and that unless
     * `strictfp` is in force even the result of `(a + b) + c` is sensitive to the JVM's choice of
     * precision for the intermediate result.) This method is recommended when the code under test
     * is specified as either copying values without modification from its input or returning
     * well-defined literal or constant values.
     *
     * - It considers [Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY], [Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY], and
