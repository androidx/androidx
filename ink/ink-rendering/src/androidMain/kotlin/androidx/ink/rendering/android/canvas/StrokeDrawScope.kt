     * Pre-allocated value updated in [onDrawStart] holding a transform from the
     * implementation-defined "initial" transform state of the canvas to screen coordinates as
     * described below.
     *
     * We want to be able to calculate the complete (Local -> Screen) transform inside [drawStroke].
     * The only options to track changes made by client code to the [Canvas] transform state are:
     * 1. Require the user to explicitly pass the transform as in [CanvasStrokeRenderer],
     * 2. Create and require clients to use a complete [Canvas] wrapper type, or
     * 3. Make use of the deprecated [Canvas.getMatrix] method.
     *
     * Option 1 is provided, but cumbersome for clients. We are avoiding option 2, because it would
     * also be cumbersome client code, and we would need to track every API adding or breaking
     * change in [Canvas].
     *
     * Part of the reason for the deprecation documented on [Canvas.getMatrix] is that hardware
     * accelerated canvases have an implementation-defined matrix value when passed to a `View`,
     * because they may be anywhere in the `View` hierarchy. However, we can use the delta between
     * the values returned by two calls to [Canvas.getMatrix] to find the relative change in
     * transformations.
     *
     * We assume that any non-identity value of the matrix at the start of [onDrawStart] is already
     * part of the `canvasToScreenTransform` passed to [onDrawStart] as shown in the following
     * diagram:
     *
     *                     |-       [canvasToScreenTransform]         -|
     *                     |                                           |
     *                     |                   |-  canvas.getMatrix() -|
     *                     |                   |    in [onDrawStart]   |
     *
     * (Local -> Screen) = (Initial -> Screen) * (Canvas ---> Initial) * (Local -> Canvas)
     *
     *                                         |           canvas.getMatrix()            |
