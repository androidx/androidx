/**
 * Renders strokes to a [Canvas].
 *
 * In almost all cases, a developer should use an implementation of this interface obtained from
 * [CanvasStrokeRenderer.create].
 *
 * However, some developers may find it helpful to use their own implementation of this interface,
 * possibly to draw other effects to the [Canvas], typically delegating to a renderer from
 * [CanvasStrokeRenderer.create] for part of the custom rendering behavior to have the additional
 * effects add to or modify the standard stroke rendering behavior. Custom [CanvasStrokeRenderer]
 * implementations are generally less efficient than effects that can be achieved with a custom
 * [androidx.ink.brush.BrushFamily]. If a custom implementation draws to different screen locations
 * than the standard implementation, for example surrounding a stroke with additional content, then
 * that additional content will not be taken into account in geometry operations like
 * [androidx.ink.geometry.Intersection] or [androidx.ink.geometry.PartitionedMesh.computeCoverage].
 *
 * If custom rendering is needed during live authoring of in-progress strokes and that custom
 * rendering involves drawing content outside the stroke boundaries, then be sure to override
 * [strokeModifiedRegionOutsetPx].
