/**
 * Use an [InProgressStroke] to efficiently build a stroke over multiple rendering frames with
 * incremental inputs.
 *
 * To use an [InProgressStroke], you would typically:
 * 1. Begin a stroke by calling [start] with a chosen [Brush].
 * 2. Repeatedly update the stroke:
 *     1. Call [enqueueInputs] with any new real and predicted stroke inputs.
 *     2. Call [updateShape] when [needsUpdate] is `true` and new geometry is needed for rendering.
 *     3. Render the current stroke mesh or outlines, either via a provided renderer that accepts an
 *        [InProgressStroke] or by using the various getters on this type with a custom renderer.
 * 3. Call [finishInput] once there are no more inputs for this stroke (e.g. the user lifts the
 *    stylus from the screen).
 * 4. Continue to call [updateShape] and render after [finishInput] until [getNeedsUpdate] returns
 *    false (to allow any lingering brush animations to complete).
 * 5. Extract the completed stroke by calling [toImmutable].
 * 6. For best performance, reuse this object and go back to step 1 rather than allocating a new
 *    instance.
