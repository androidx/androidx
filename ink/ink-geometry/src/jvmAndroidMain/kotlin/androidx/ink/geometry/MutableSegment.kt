/**
 * Represents a mutable directed line segment between two points. See [ImmutableSegment] for the
 * immutable alternative.
 *
 * @constructor Create the [MutableSegment] from two existing [MutableVec] instances. Note that
 *   these instances will become the internal state of this [MutableSegment], so modifications made
 *   to them directly or through setters on this [MutableSegment] will modify the input [MutableVec]
 *   instances too. This is to allow performance-critical code to avoid any unnecessary allocations.
 *   This can be tricky to manage, especially in multithreaded code, so when calling code is unable
 *   to guarantee ownership of the nested mutable data at a particular time, it may be safest to
 *   construct this with copies of the data to give this [MutableSegment] exclusive ownership of
 *   those copies.
