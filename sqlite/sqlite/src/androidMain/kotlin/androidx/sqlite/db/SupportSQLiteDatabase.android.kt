     * journal mode is also changed to enable writes to proceed concurrently with reads.
     *
     * When write-ahead logging is not enabled (the default), it is not possible for
     * reads and writes to occur on the database at the same time.  Before modifying the
     * database, the writer implicitly acquires an exclusive lock on the database which
     * prevents readers from accessing the database until the write is completed.
     *
     * In contrast, when write-ahead logging is enabled (by calling this method), write
     * operations occur in a separate log file which allows reads to proceed concurrently.
     * While a write is in progress, readers on other threads will perceive the state
     * of the database as it was before the write began.  When the write completes, readers
     * on other threads will then perceive the new state of the database.
     *
     * It is a good idea to enable write-ahead logging whenever a database will be
     * concurrently accessed and modified by multiple threads at the same time.
     * However, write-ahead logging uses significantly more memory than ordinary
     * journaling because there are multiple connections to the same database.
     * So if a database will only be used by a single thread, or if optimizing
     * concurrency is not very important, then write-ahead logging should be disabled.
     *
     * After calling this method, execution of queries in parallel is enabled as long as
     * the database remains open.  To disable execution of queries in parallel, either
     * call [disableWriteAheadLogging] or close the database and reopen it.
     *
     * The maximum number of connections used to execute queries in parallel is
     * dependent upon the device memory and possibly other properties.
     *
     * If a query is part of a transaction, then it is executed on the same database handle the
     * transaction was begun.
     *
     * Writers should use [beginTransactionNonExclusive] or
     * [beginTransactionWithListenerNonExclusive]
     * to start a transaction.  Non-exclusive mode allows database file to be in readable
     * by other threads executing queries.
     *
     * If the database has any attached databases, then execution of queries in parallel is NOT
     * possible.  Likewise, write-ahead logging is not supported for read-only databases
     * or memory databases.  In such cases, `enableWriteAheadLogging` returns false.
     *
     * The best way to enable write-ahead logging is to pass the
     * [android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase.ENABLE_WRITE_AHEAD_LOGGING] flag to
     * [android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase]. This is more efficient than calling
