     * Launch [block] in [context], returning a [ListenableFuture] to manage the launched operation.
     * [block] will run **synchronously** to its first suspend point, behaving as
     * [CoroutineStart.UNDISPATCHED] by default; set [launchUndispatched] to false to override
     * and behave as [CoroutineStart.DEFAULT].
     *
     * [launchFuture] can be used to write adapters for calling suspending functions from the
     * Java programming language, e.g.
     *
     * ```
     * @file:JvmName("FancyServices")
     *
     * fun FancyService.requestAsync(
     *     args: FancyServiceArgs
     * ): ListenableFuture<FancyResult> = SuspendToFutureAdapter.launchFuture {
     *     request(args)
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * which can be called from Java language source code as follows:
     * ```
     * final ListenableFuture<FancyResult> result = FancyServices.requestAsync(service, args);
     * ```
     *
     * If no [kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineDispatcher] is provided in [context], [Dispatchers.Main]
     * is used as the default. [ListenableFuture.get] should not be called from the main thread
     * prior to the future's completion (whether it was obtained from [SuspendToFutureAdapter]
     * or not) as any operation performed in the process of completing the future may require
     * main thread event processing in order to proceed, leading to potential main thread deadlock.
     *
     * If the operation performed by [block] is known to be safe for potentially reentrant
     * continuation resumption, immediate dispatchers such as [Dispatchers.Unconfined] may be used
     * as part of [context] to avoid additional thread dispatch latency. This should not be used
     * as a means of supporting clients blocking the main thread using [ListenableFuture.get];
     * this support can be broken by valid internal implementation changes to any transitive
     * dependencies of the operation performed by [block].
