/**
 * A utility useful for adapting interfaces that take callbacks into interfaces that return {@link
 * ListenableFuture}.
 * <p>
 * It also provides additional safety checks, failing the future if it will never complete.
 *
 * <p>For example, you work with the following async api:
 * <pre>
 * class AsyncApi  {
 *     interface OnResult {
 *         void onSuccess(Foo foo);
 *         void onError(Failure failure);
 *     }
 *
 *     void load(OnResult onResult) {}
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Code that wraps it as {@code ListenableFuture} would look like:
 * <pre>
 * ListenableFuture&lt;Foo&gt; asyncOperation() {
 *     return CallbackToFutureAdapter.getFuture(completer -> {
 *         asyncApi.load(new OnResult() {
 *             &#64;Override
 *             public void onSuccess(Foo foo) {
 *                 completer.set(foo);
 *             }
 *
 *             &#64;Override
 *             public void onError(Failure failure) {
 *                 completer.setException(failure.exception);
 *             }
 *         });
 *         // This value is used only for debug purposes: it will be used in toString()
 *         // of returned future or error cases.
 *         return "AsyncApi.load operation";
 *     });
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p> Try to avoid creating references from listeners on the returned {@code Future} to the {@link
 * Completer} or the passed-in {@code tag} object, as this will defeat the best-effort early failure
 * detection based on garbage collection.
