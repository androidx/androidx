/**
 * A scope that owns [SavedStateRegistry]
 *
 * This owner should be passed in to create a [SavedStateRegistryController] object through which
 * this owner can access and perform operations via the controller's [SavedStateRegistry]
 *
 * [SavedStateRegistryController.performAttach] must be called once (and only once) on the main
 * thread during the owner's [Lifecycle.State.INITIALIZED] state. It should be called before you
 * call [SavedStateRegistryController.performRestore]
 *
 * [SavedStateRegistryController.performRestore] can be called with a nullable if nothing needs to
 * be restored, or with the SavedState to be restored. performRestore can be called in one of two
 * places:
 * 1. Directly before the Lifecycle moves to [Lifecycle.State.CREATED]
 * 2. Before [Lifecycle.State.STARTED] is reached, as part of the [LifecycleObserver] that is added
 *    during owner initialization
 *
 * [SavedStateRegistryController.performSave] should be called after owner has been stopped but
 * before it reaches [Lifecycle.State.DESTROYED] state. Hence it should only be called once the
 * owner has received the [Lifecycle.Event.ON_STOP] event. The SavedState passed to performSave will
 * be the SavedState restored by performRestore.
