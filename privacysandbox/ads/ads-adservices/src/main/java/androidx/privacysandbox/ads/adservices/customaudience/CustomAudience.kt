/**
 * Represents the information necessary for a custom audience to participate in ad selection.
 *
 * A custom audience is an abstract grouping of users with similar demonstrated interests. This
 * class is a collection of some data stored on a device that is necessary to serve advertisements
 * targeting a single custom audience.
 *
 * @param buyer A buyer is identified by a domain in the form "buyerexample.com".
 * @param name The custom audience's name is an arbitrary string provided by the owner and buyer on
 * creation of the [CustomAudience] object.
 * @param dailyUpdateUri a URI that points to a buyer-operated server that hosts updated bidding
 * data and ads metadata to be used in the on-device ad selection process. The URI must use HTTPS.
 * @param biddingLogicUri the target URI used to fetch bidding logic when a custom audience
 * participates in the ad selection process. The URI must use HTTPS.
 * @param ads the list of [AdData] objects is a full and complete list of the ads that will be
 * served by this [CustomAudience] during the ad selection process.
 * @param activationTime optional activation time may be set in the future, in order to serve a
 * delayed activation. If the field is not set, the object will be activated at the time of joining.
 * @param expirationTime optional expiration time. Once it has passed, a custom audience is no
 * longer eligible for daily ad/bidding data updates or participation in the ad selection process.
 * The custom audience will then be deleted from memory by the next daily update.
 * @param userBiddingSignals optional User bidding signals, provided by buyers to be consumed by
 * buyer-provided JavaScript during ad selection in an isolated execution environment.
 * @param trustedBiddingSignals optional trusted bidding data, consists of a URI pointing to a
 * trusted server for buyers' bidding data and a list of keys to query the server with.
