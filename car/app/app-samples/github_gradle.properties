# Properties that are copied from main properties file
# We set playground properties in two steps:
# * This file is linked into github_gradle.properties under the project and limited to
#   just copying properties from the androidx properties file without any change.
#   Its integrity is validated as part of the buildOnServer task in AndroidX.
#   (validatePlaygroundGradleProperties task)
# * Additional settings are in playground.properties which are loaded dynamically
# This separation is necessary to ensure gradle can read certain properties
# at configuration time.
