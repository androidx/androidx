/**
 * A corruption handler that attempts to replace the on-disk data with data from produceNewData.
 *
 * If the handler successfully replaces the data, the original exception is swallowed.
 * If the handler encounters an exception when attempting to replace data, the new exception is
 * added as a suppressed exception to the original exception and the original exception is thrown.
 *
 * @param produceNewData The provided callback returns the data to be written to disk. If the
 * callback fails, nothing will be written to disk. Since the exception will be swallowed after
 * writing the data, this is a good place to log the exception.
