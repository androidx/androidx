/**
 * A corruption handler that attempts to replace the on-disk data with data from produceNewData.
 *
 * If the handler successfully replaces the data, the original exception is swallowed. If the
 * handler encounters an exception when attempting to replace data, the new exception is added as a
 * suppressed exception to the original exception and the original exception is thrown.
 *
 * @param produceNewData The provided callback returns the data to be written to disk. If the
 *   callback fails, nothing will be written to disk. Since the exception will be swallowed after
 *   writing the data, this is a good place to log the exception.
