     * continue to process additional checks. If the condition fails then the
     * [SpecificationComputer] will have different behavior depending on the verification mode. If
     * the verification mode is [STRICT] an [Exception] will be thrown when [compute] is

     * mode is [QUIET] then an empty [SpecificationComputer] is returned.
     *
     * Use [require] when an assumption must be true. One key example is when translating from an
     * OEM provided library into a local object you want to verify the attributes. If an attribute
     * does not match expectations then this can raise an exception at the source.
     *
     * One use case for this is our integration tests for devices. We can write good assumptions in
     * a test because we would need external knowledge of the device. One example is a device with a
     * fold. We expect the fold to propagate through the translation layer but we can only assert
     * the presence of a fold if we know the device has a fold. As a substitution we can turn on
     * strict mode and this will throw an exception when translating causing the test to fail.
