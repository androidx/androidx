     * Attempting to start a transfer session when the [WindowAreaInfo] does not return

     * [WindowAreaSessionCallback.onSessionEnded] containing an [IllegalStateException]
     *
     * Only the top visible application can request to start a transfer session.
     *
     * The calling [Activity] will likely go through a configuration change since the window area it
     * will be transferred to is usually different from the current area the [Activity] is in. The
     * callback is retained during the lifetime of the session. If an [Activity] is captured in the
     * callback and it does not handle the configuration change then it will be leaked. Consider
     * using an [androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel] since that is meant to outlive the [Activity]
     * lifecycle. If the [Activity] does override configuration changes, it is safe to have the
     * [Activity] handle the WindowAreaSessionCallback. This guarantees that the calling [Activity]
     * will continue to receive [WindowAreaSessionCallback.onSessionEnded] and keep a handle to the
     * [WindowAreaSession] provided through [WindowAreaSessionCallback.onSessionStarted].
     *
     * The [windowAreaSessionCallback] provided will receive a call to
     * [WindowAreaSessionCallback.onSessionStarted] after the [Activity] has been transferred to the
     * window area. The transfer session will stay active until the session provided through
     * [WindowAreaSessionCallback.onSessionStarted] is closed. Depending on the
     * [WindowAreaInfo.Type] there may be other triggers that end the session, such as if a device
     * state change makes the window area unavailable. One example of this is if the [Activity] is
     * currently transferred to the [TYPE_REAR_FACING] window area of a foldable device, the session
     * will be ended when the device is closed. When this occurs,
     * [WindowAreaSessionCallback.onSessionEnded] is called.
     *
