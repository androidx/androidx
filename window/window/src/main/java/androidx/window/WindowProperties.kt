     * Application level [android.content.pm.PackageManager.Property] tag for developers to
     * provide consent for their app to allow OEMs to manually provide ActivityEmbedding split
     * rule configuration on behalf of the app.
     * <p>If `true`, the system can override the windowing behaviors for the app, such as
     * showing some activities side-by-side. In this case, it will report that ActivityEmbedding
     * APIs are disabled for the app to avoid conflict.
     * <p>If `false`, the system can't override the window behavior for the app. It should
     * be used if the app wants to provide their own ActivityEmbedding split rules, or if the
     * app wants to opt-out of system overrides for any other reason.
     * <p>Default is `false`.
     * <p>The system enforcement will be added in Android 14, but some devices may start following
     * the requirement before that. The best practice for apps is to always explicitly set this
     * property in AndroidManifest instead of relying on the default value.
     * <p>Example usage:
     * <pre>
     * &lt;application&gt;
     *   &lt;property
     *     android:name="android.window.PROPERTY_ACTIVITY_EMBEDDING_ALLOW_SYSTEM_OVERRIDE"
     *     android:value="true|false"/&gt;
     * &lt;/application&gt;
     * </pre>
