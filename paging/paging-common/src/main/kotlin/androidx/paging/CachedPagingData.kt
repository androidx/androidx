/**
 * Caches the [PagingData] such that any downstream collection from this flow will share the same
 * [PagingData].
 *
 * The flow is kept active as long as the given [scope] is active. To avoid leaks, make sure to
 * use a [scope] that is already managed (like a ViewModel scope) or manually cancel it when you
 * don't need paging anymore.
 *
 * A common use case for this caching is to cache [PagingData] in a ViewModel. This can ensure that,
 * upon configuration change (e.g. rotation), then new Activity will receive the existing data
 * immediately rather than fetching it from scratch.
 *
 * Calling [cachedIn] is required to allow calling
 * [submitData][androidx.paging.AsyncPagingDataAdapter] on the same instance of [PagingData]
 * emitted by [Pager] or any of its transformed derivatives, as reloading data from scratch on the
 * same generation of [PagingData] is an unsupported operation.
 *
 * Note that this does not turn the `Flow<PagingData>` into a hot stream. It won't execute any
 * unnecessary code unless it is being collected.
 *
 * @sample androidx.paging.samples.cachedInSample
 *
 * @param scope The coroutine scope where this page cache will be kept alive.
