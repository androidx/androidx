/**
 * This is a simplified channelFlow implementation as a temporary measure until channel flow
 * leaves experimental state.
 *
 * The exact same implementation is not possible due to [FusibleFlow] being an internal API. To
 * get close to that implementation, internally we use a [Channel.RENDEZVOUS] channel and use a
 * [buffer] ([Channel.BUFFERED]) operator on the resulting Flow. This gives us a close behavior
 * where the default is buffered and any followup buffer operation will result in +1 value being
 * produced.
