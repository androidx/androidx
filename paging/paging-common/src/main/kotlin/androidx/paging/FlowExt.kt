 * The emissions for both Flows are also guaranteed to get buffered, so if one Flow emits
 * multiple times before the other does, [transform] will get called for each emission from the
 * first Flow instead of just once with the latest values.
 *
 * @param transform The transform to apply on each update. This is first called after awaiting an
 * initial emission from both Flows, and then is guaranteed to be called for every emission from
 * either Flow.
 *
 * For convenience, [CombineSource] is also passed to the transform, which indicates the
 * origin of the update with the following possible values:
 *   * [INITIAL]: Initial emission from both Flows
 *   * [RECEIVER]: Triggered by new emission from receiver
