 *  * [REFRESH] signal driven from UI
 *  * [PagingSource] returns a [LoadResult] which signals a boundary condition, i.e., the most
 *  recent [LoadResult.Page] in the [PREPEND] or [APPEND] direction has [LoadResult.Page.prevKey]

     *  * [PagingSource] returns a [LoadResult] which signals a boundary condition, i.e., the most

     *  [LoadResult.Page.prevKey] or [LoadResult.Page.nextKey] set to `null` respectively.
     *
     * It is the responsibility of this method to update the backing dataset and trigger
     * [PagingSource.invalidate] to allow [androidx.paging.PagingDataAdapter] to pick up new
     * items found by [load].
     *
     * The runtime and result of this method defines the remote [LoadState] behavior sent to the
     * UI via [CombinedLoadStates].
     *
     * This method is never called concurrently *unless* [Pager.flow] has multiple collectors.
     * Note that Paging might cancel calls to this function if it is currently executing a
     * [PREPEND] or [APPEND] and a [REFRESH] is requested. In that case, [REFRESH] has higher
     * priority and will be executed after the previous call is cancelled. If the [load] call with
     * [REFRESH] returns an error, Paging will call [load] with the previously cancelled [APPEND]
     * or [PREPEND] request. If [REFRESH] succeeds, it won't make the [APPEND] or [PREPEND] requests
     * unless they are necessary again after the [REFRESH] is applied to the UI.
     *
     * @param loadType [LoadType] of the condition which triggered this callback.
     *  * [PREPEND] indicates the end of pagination in the [PREPEND] direction was reached. This
     *  occurs when [PagingSource.load] returns a [LoadResult.Page] with
     *  [LoadResult.Page.prevKey] == `null`.
     *  * [APPEND] indicates the end of pagination in the [APPEND] direction was reached. This
     *  occurs when [PagingSource.load] returns a [LoadResult.Page] with
     *  [LoadResult.Page.nextKey] == `null`.
     *  * [REFRESH] indicates this method was triggered due to a requested refresh. Generally, this
     *  means that a request to load remote data and **replace** all local data was made. This can
     *  happen when:
     *    * Stream initialization if [initialize] returns [LAUNCH_INITIAL_REFRESH]
     *    * An explicit call to refresh driven by the UI
     * @param state A copy of the state including the list of pages currently held in memory of the
     * currently presented [PagingData] at the time of starting the load. E.g. for
     * load(loadType = APPEND), you can use the page or item at the end as input for what to load
     * from the network.
