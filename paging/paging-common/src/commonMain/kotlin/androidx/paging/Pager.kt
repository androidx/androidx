/**
 * Primary entry point into Paging; constructor for a reactive stream of [PagingData].
 *
 * Each [PagingData] represents a snapshot of the backing paginated data. Updates to the backing
 * dataset should be represented by a new instance of [PagingData].
 *
 * [PagingSource.invalidate] and calls to [AsyncPagingDataDiffer.refresh] or
 * [PagingDataAdapter.refresh] will notify [Pager] that the backing dataset has been updated and a
 * new [PagingData] / [PagingSource] pair will be generated to represent an updated snapshot.
 *
 * [PagingData] can be transformed to alter data as it loads, and presented in a `RecyclerView` via
 * `AsyncPagingDataDiffer` or `PagingDataAdapter`.
 *
 * LiveData support is available as an extension property provided by the
 * `androidx.paging:paging-runtime` artifact.
 *
 * RxJava support is available as extension properties provided by the
 * `androidx.paging:paging-rxjava2` artifact.
