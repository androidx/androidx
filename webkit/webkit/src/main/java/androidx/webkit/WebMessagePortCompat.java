/**
 * <p>The Java representation of the
 * <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#messageport">
 * HTML5 message ports.</a>
 *
 * <p>A Message port represents one endpoint of a Message Channel. In Android
 * webview, there is no separate Message Channel object. When a message channel
 * is created, both ports are tangled to each other and started, and then
 * returned in a MessagePort array, see {@link WebViewCompat#createWebMessageChannel}
 * for creating a message channel.
 *
 * <p>When a message port is first created or received via transfer, it does not
 * have a WebMessageCallback to receive web messages. The messages are queued until
 * a WebMessageCallback is set.
 *
 * <p>A message port should be closed when it is not used by the embedder application
 * anymore. A closed port cannot be transferred or cannot be reopened to send
 * messages. Close can be called multiple times.
 *
 * <p>When a port is transferred to JS, it cannot be used to send or receive messages
 * at the Java side anymore. Different from HTML5 Spec, a port cannot be transferred
 * if one of these has ever happened: i. a message callback was set, ii. a message was
 * posted on it. A transferred port cannot be closed by the application, since
 * the ownership is also transferred.
 *
 * <p>It is possible to transfer both ports of a channel to JS, for example for
 * communication between subframes.
