/**
 * A class that can perform work asynchronously in {@link WorkManager}.  For most cases, we
 * recommend using {@link Worker}, which offers a simple synchronous API that is executed on a
 * pre-specified background thread.
 * <p>
 * ListenableWorker classes are instantiated at runtime by the {@link WorkerFactory} specified in
 * the {@link Configuration}.  The {@link #startWork()} method is called on the main thread.
 * <p>
 * In case the work is preempted and later restarted for any reason, a new instance of
 * ListenableWorker is created. This means that {@code startWork} is called exactly once per
 * ListenableWorker instance.  A new ListenableWorker is created if a unit of work needs to be
 * rerun.
 * <p>
 * A ListenableWorker is given a maximum of ten minutes to finish its execution and return a
 * {@link Result}.  After this time has expired, the worker will be signalled to stop and its
 * {@link ListenableFuture} will be cancelled.
 * <p>
 * Exercise caution when <a href="WorkManager.html#worker_class_names">renaming or removing
 * ListenableWorkers</a> from your codebase.
