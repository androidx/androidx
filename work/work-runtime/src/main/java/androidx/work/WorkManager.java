/**
 * WorkManager the recommended library for persistent work.
 * Scheduled work is is guaranteed to execute sometime after its {@link Constraints} are met.
 * WorkManager allows observation of work status and the ability to create complex chains of work.
 * <p>
 * WorkManager uses an underlying job dispatching service when available based on the following
 * criteria:
 * <p><ul>
 * <li>Uses JobScheduler for API 23+
 * <li>Uses a custom AlarmManager + BroadcastReceiver implementation for API 14-22</ul>
 * <p>
 * All work must be done in a {@link ListenableWorker} class.  A simple implementation,
 * {@link Worker}, is recommended as the starting point for most developers.  With the optional
 * dependencies, you can also use {@code CoroutineWorker} or {@code RxWorker}.  All background work
 * is given a maximum of ten minutes to finish its execution.  After this time has expired, the
 * worker will be signalled to stop.
 * <p>
 * There are two types of work supported by WorkManager: {@link OneTimeWorkRequest} and
 * {@link PeriodicWorkRequest}.  You can enqueue requests using WorkManager as follows:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * WorkManager workManager = WorkManager.getInstance(Context);
 * workManager.enqueue(new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(FooWorker.class).build());
 * </pre>
 *
 * A {@link WorkRequest} has an associated id that can be used for lookups and observation as
 * follows:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * WorkRequest request = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(FooWorker.class).build();
 * workManager.enqueue(request);
 * LiveData<WorkInfo> status = workManager.getWorkInfoByIdLiveData(request.getId());
 * status.observe(...);
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can also use the id for cancellation:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * WorkRequest request = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(FooWorker.class).build();
 * workManager.enqueue(request);
 * workManager.cancelWorkById(request.getId());
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can chain work as follows:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * WorkRequest request1 = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(FooWorker.class).build();
 * WorkRequest request2 = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(BarWorker.class).build();
 * WorkRequest request3 = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(BazWorker.class).build();
 * workManager.beginWith(request1, request2).then(request3).enqueue();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Each call to {@link #beginWith(OneTimeWorkRequest)} or {@link #beginWith(List)} returns a
 * {@link WorkContinuation} upon which you can call
 * {@link WorkContinuation#then(OneTimeWorkRequest)} or {@link WorkContinuation#then(List)} to
 * chain further work.  This allows for creation of complex chains of work.  For example, to create
 * a chain like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *            A
 *            |
 *      +----------+
 *      |          |
 *      B          C
 *      |
 *   +----+
 *   |    |
 *   D    E             </pre>
 *
 * you would enqueue them as follows:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * WorkContinuation continuation = workManager.beginWith(A);
 * continuation.then(B).then(D, E).enqueue();  // A is implicitly enqueued here
 * continuation.then(C).enqueue();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Work is eligible for execution when all of its prerequisites are complete.  If any of its
 * prerequisites fail or are cancelled, the work will never run.
 * <p>
 * WorkRequests can accept {@link Constraints}, inputs (see {@link Data}), and backoff criteria.
 * WorkRequests can be tagged with human-readable Strings
 * (see {@link WorkRequest.Builder#addTag(String)}), and chains of work can be given a
 * uniquely-identifiable name (see
 * {@link #beginUniqueWork(String, ExistingWorkPolicy, OneTimeWorkRequest)}).
 * <p>
 * <a name="initializing"></a>
 * <b>Initializing WorkManager</b>
 * <p>
 * By default, WorkManager auto-initializes itself using a built-in {@code ContentProvider}.
 * ContentProviders are created and run before the {@code Application} object, so this allows the
 * WorkManager singleton to be setup before your code can run in most cases.  This is suitable for
 * most developers.  However, you can provide a custom {@link Configuration} by using
 * {@link Configuration.Provider} or
 * {@link WorkManager#initialize(android.content.Context, androidx.work.Configuration)}.
 * <p>
 * <a name="worker_class_names"></a>
 * <b>Renaming and Removing ListenableWorker Classes</b>
 * <p>
 * Exercise caution in renaming classes derived from {@link ListenableWorker}s.  WorkManager stores
 * the class name in its internal database when the {@link WorkRequest} is enqueued so it can later
 * create an instance of that worker when constraints are met.  Unless otherwise specified in the
 * WorkManager {@link Configuration}, this is done in the default {@link WorkerFactory} which tries
 * to reflectively create the ListenableWorker object.  Therefore, renaming or removing these
 * classes is dangerous - if there is pending work with the given class, it will fail permanently
 * if the class cannot be found.  If you are using a custom WorkerFactory, make sure you properly
 * handle cases where the class is not found so that your code does not crash.
 * <p>
 * In case it is desirable to rename a class, implement a custom WorkerFactory that instantiates the
 * right ListenableWorker for the old class name.
