/**
 * A [WorkRequest] for repeating work.  This work executes multiple times until it is
 * cancelled, with the first execution happening immediately or as soon as the given
 * [Constraints] are met.  The next execution will happen during the period interval; note
 * that execution may be delayed because [WorkManager] is subject to OS battery optimizations,
 * such as doze mode.
 *
 * You can control when the work executes in the period interval more exactly - see
 * [PeriodicWorkRequest.Builder] for documentation on `flexInterval`s.
 *
 * Periodic work has a minimum interval of 15 minutes.
 *
 * Periodic work is intended for use cases where you want a fairly consistent delay between
 * consecutive runs, and you are willing to accept inexactness due to battery optimizations and doze
 * mode.  Please note that if your periodic work has constraints, it will not execute until the
 * constraints are met, even if the delay between periods has been met.
 *
 * If you need to schedule work that happens exactly at a certain time or only during a certain time
 * window, you should consider using [OneTimeWorkRequest]s.
 *
 * The normal lifecycle of a PeriodicWorkRequest is `ENQUEUED -> RUNNING -> ENQUEUED`.  By
 * definition, periodic work cannot terminate in a succeeded or failed state, since it must recur.
 * It can only terminate if explicitly cancelled.  However, in the case of retries, periodic work
 * will still back off according to [PeriodicWorkRequest.Builder.setBackoffCriteria].
 *
 * Periodic work cannot be part of a chain or graph of work.

         * overriding the normal interval, flex, initial delay, and backoff.
         *
         * This allows dynamic calculation of the next Periodic work schedule, which can be used
         * to implement advanced features like adaptive refresh times, custom retry behavior, or
         * making a newsfeed worker run before the user wakes up every morning without drift.
         * [ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.UPDATE] should be used with these techniques to avoid
         * cancelling a currently-running worker while scheduling the next one.
         *
         * This method only sets the single next Work schedule. After that Work finishes,
         * the override will be cleared and the Work will be scheduled normally according to the
         * interval or backoff. The override can be cleared by setting
         * [clearNextScheduleTimeOverride] on a work update request. Otherwise, the override time
         * will persist after unrelated invocations of [WorkManager.updateWork].
         *
         * This method can be used from outside or inside a [Worker.startWork] method.
         * If the Worker is currently running, then it will override the next time the Work starts,
         * even if the current Worker returns [ListenableWorker.Result.Retry]. This behavior can be
         * used to customize the backoff behavior of a Worker by catching Exceptions in startWork
         * and using this method to schedule a retry.
         *
         * [MIN_PERIODIC_INTERVAL_MILLIS] is enforced on this method to prevent infinite loops. If
         * a previous run time occurred less than the minimum period before the override time, then
         * the override schedule will be delayed to preserve the minimum spacing. This restriction
         * does not apply to the very first run of periodic work, which may be instant.
         *
         * Work will almost never run at this exact time in the real world. This method assigns the
         * scheduled run time accurately, but cannot guarantee an actual run time. Actual Work
         * run times are dependent on many factors like the underlying system scheduler, doze and
         * power saving modes of the OS, and meeting any configured constraints. This is expected
