/**
 * WorkManager is the recommended library for persistent work. Scheduled work is guaranteed to
 * execute sometime after its [Constraints] are met. WorkManager allows observation of work status
 * and the ability to create complex chains of work.
 *
 * WorkManager uses an underlying job dispatching service when available based on the following
 * criteria:
 * * Uses JobScheduler for API 23+
 * * Uses a custom AlarmManager + BroadcastReceiver implementation for API 14-22
 *
 * All work must be done in a [ListenableWorker] class. A simple implementation, [Worker], is
 * recommended as the starting point for most developers. With the optional dependencies, you can
 * also use `CoroutineWorker` or `RxWorker`. All background work is given a maximum of ten minutes
 * to finish its execution. After this time has expired, the worker will be signalled to stop.
 *
 * There are two types of work supported by WorkManager: [OneTimeWorkRequest] and
 * [PeriodicWorkRequest]. You can enqueue requests using WorkManager as follows:
 * ```
 * WorkManager workManager = WorkManager.getInstance(Context);
 * workManager.enqueue(new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(FooWorker.class).build());
 * ```
 *
 * A [WorkRequest] has an associated id that can be used for lookups and observation as follows:
 * ```
 * WorkRequest request = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(FooWorker.class).build();
 * workManager.enqueue(request);
 * LiveData<WorkInfo> status = workManager.getWorkInfoByIdLiveData(request.getId());
 * status.observe(...);
 * ```
 *
 * You can also use the id for cancellation:
 * ```
 * WorkRequest request = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(FooWorker.class).build();
 * workManager.enqueue(request);
 * workManager.cancelWorkById(request.getId());
 * ```
 *
 * You can chain work as follows:
 * ```
 * WorkRequest request1 = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(FooWorker.class).build();
 * WorkRequest request2 = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(BarWorker.class).build();
 * WorkRequest request3 = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(BazWorker.class).build();
 * workManager.beginWith(request1, request2).then(request3).enqueue();
 * ```
 *
 * Each call to [beginWith] returns a [WorkContinuation] upon which you can call
 * [WorkContinuation.then] with a single [OneTimeWorkRequest] or a list of [OneTimeWorkRequest] to
 * chain further work. This allows for creation of complex chains of work. For example, to create a
 * chain like this:
 * ```
 *            A
 *            |
 *      +----------+
 *      |          |
 *      B          C
 *      |
 *   +----+
 *   |    |
 *   D    E
 * ```
 *
 * you would enqueue them as follows:
 * ```
 * WorkContinuation continuation = workManager.beginWith(A);
 * continuation.then(B).then(D, E).enqueue();  // A is implicitly enqueued here
 * continuation.then(C).enqueue();
 * ```
 *
 * Work is eligible for execution when all of its prerequisites are complete. If any of its
 * prerequisites fail or are cancelled, the work will never run.
 *
 * WorkRequests can accept [Constraints], inputs (see [Data]), and backoff criteria. WorkRequests
 * can be tagged with human-readable Strings (see [WorkRequest.Builder.addTag]), and chains of work
 * can be given a uniquely-identifiable name (see [beginUniqueWork]).
 *
 * ### Initializing WorkManager
 *
 * By default, WorkManager auto-initializes itself using a built-in `ContentProvider`.
 * ContentProviders are created and run before the `Application` object, so this allows the
 * WorkManager singleton to be setup before your code can run in most cases. This is suitable for
 * most developers. However, you can provide a custom [Configuration] by using
 * [Configuration.Provider] or [WorkManager.initialize].
 *
 * ### Renaming and Removing ListenableWorker Classes
 *
 * Exercise caution in renaming classes derived from [ListenableWorker]s. WorkManager stores the
 * class name in its internal database when the [WorkRequest] is enqueued so it can later create an
 * instance of that worker when constraints are met. Unless otherwise specified in the WorkManager
 * [Configuration], this is done in the default [WorkerFactory] which tries to reflectively create
 * the ListenableWorker object. Therefore, renaming or removing these classes is dangerous - if
 * there is pending work with the given class, it will fail permanently if the class cannot be
 * found. If you are using a custom WorkerFactory, make sure you properly handle cases where the
 * class is not found so that your code does not crash.
 *
 * In case it is desirable to rename a class, implement a custom WorkerFactory that instantiates the
 * right ListenableWorker for the old class name.
