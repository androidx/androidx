/**
 * Material surfaces can be displayed in different shapes. Shapes direct attention, identify
 * components, communicate state, and express brand.
 *
 * The shape scale defines the style of container corners, offering a range of roundedness from
 * square to fully circular.
 *
 * There are different sizes of shapes:
 * - Extra Small
 * - Small
 * - Medium
 * - Large, Large Increased
 * - Extra Large, Extra Large Increased
 * - Extra Extra Large
 *
 * You can customize the shape system for all components in the [MaterialTheme] or you can do it on
 * a per component basis.
 *
 * You can change the shape that a component has by overriding the shape parameter for that
 * component. For example, by default, buttons use the shape style “full.” If your product requires
 * a smaller amount of roundedness, you can override the shape parameter with a different shape
 * value like [MaterialTheme.shapes.small].
 *
 * To learn more about shapes, see
 * [Material Design shapes](https://m3.material.io/styles/shape/overview).
 *
 * @param extraSmall A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than
 *   [RectangleShape] and smaller than [Shapes.small]. By default autocomplete menu, select menu,
 *   snackbars, standard menu, and text fields use this shape.
 * @param small A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than
 *   [Shapes.extraSmall] and smaller than [Shapes.medium]. By default chips use this shape.
 * @param medium A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than [Shapes.small]
 *   and smaller than [Shapes.large]. By default cards and small FABs use this shape.
 * @param large A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than [Shapes.medium]
 *   and smaller than [Shapes.extraLarge]. By default extended FABs, FABs, and navigation drawers
 *   use this shape.
 * @param extraLarge A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than
 *   [Shapes.large] and smaller than [CircleShape]. By default large FABs use this shape.
 * @param largeIncreased A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than
 *   [Shapes.medium] and smaller than [Shapes.extraLarge]. Slightly larger variant to
 *   [Shapes.large].
 * @param extraLargeIncreased A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than
 *   [Shapes.large] and smaller than [Shapes.extraExtraLarge]. Slightly larger variant to
