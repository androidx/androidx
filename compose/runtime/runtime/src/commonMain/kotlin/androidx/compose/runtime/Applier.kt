    /**
     * Indicates that [instance] should be inserted as a child to [current] at [index]. An applier
     * should insert the node into the tree either in [insertTopDown] or [insertBottomUp], not both.
     *
     * The [insertTopDown] method is called before the children of [instance] have been created and
     * inserted into it. [insertBottomUp] is called after all children have been created and
     * inserted.
     *
     * Some trees are faster to build top-down, in which case the [insertTopDown] method should
     * be used to insert the [instance]. Other trees are faster to build bottom-up in which case
     * [insertBottomUp] should be used.
     *
     * To give example of building a tree top-down vs. bottom-up consider the following tree,
     *
     * ```
     *      R
     *      |
     *      B
     *     / \
     *    A   C
     *  ```
     *
     *  where the node `B` is being inserted into the tree at `R`. Top-down building of the tree
     *  first inserts `B` into `R`, then inserts `A` into `B` followed by inserting `C` into B`.
     *  For example,
     *
     *  ```
     *      1           2           3
     *      R           R           R
     *      |           |           |
     *      B           B           B
     *                 /           / \
     *                A           A   C
     * ```
     *
     * A bottom-up building of the tree starts with inserting `A` and `C` into `B` then inserts
     * `B` tree into `R`.
     *
     * ```
     *    1           2           3
     *    B           B           R
     *    |          / \          |
     *    A         A   C         B
     *                           / \
     *                          A   C
     * ```
     *
     * To see how building top-down vs. bottom-up can differ significantly in performance
     * consider a tree where whenever a child is added to the tree all parent nodes, up to the root,
     * are notified of the new child entering the tree. If the tree is built top-down,
     *
     *  1. `R` is notified of `B` entering.
     *  2. `B` is notified of `A` entering, `R` is notified of `A` entering.
     *  3. `B` is notified of `C` entering, `R` is notified of `C` entering.
     *
     *  for a total of 5 notifications. The number of notifications grows exponentially with the
     *  number of inserts.
     *
     *  For bottom-up, the notifications are,
     *
     *  1. `B` is notified `A` entering.
     *  2. `B` is notified `C` entering.
     *  3. `R` is notified `B` entering.
     *
     *  The notifications are linear to the number of nodes inserted.
     *
     *  If, on the other hand, all children are notified when the parent enters a tree, then the
     *  notifications are, for top-down,
     *
     *  1. `B` is notified it is entering `R`.
     *  2. `A` is notified it is entering `B`.
     *  3. `C` is notified it is entering `B`.
     *
     *  which is linear to the number of nodes inserted.
     *
     *  For bottom-up, the notifications look like,
     *
     *  1. `A` is notified it is entering `B`.
     *  2. `C` is notified it is entering `B`.
     *  3. `B` is notified it is entering `R`, `A` is notified it is entering `R`,
     *     `C` is notified it is entering `R`.
     *
     *  which exponential to the number of nodes inserted.
