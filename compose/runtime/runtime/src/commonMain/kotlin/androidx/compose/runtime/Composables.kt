/**
 * [key] is a utility composable that is used to "group" or "key" a block of execution inside of a
 * composition. This is sometimes needed for correctness inside of control-flow that may cause a
 * given composable invocation to execute more than once during composition.
 *
 * The value for a key *does not need to be globally unique*, and needs only be unique amongst the
 * invocations of [key] *at that point* in composition.
 *
 * For instance, consider the following example:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.LocallyUniqueKeys
 *
 * Even though there are users with the same id composed in both the top and the bottom loop,
 * because they are different calls to [key], there is no need to create compound keys.
 *
 * The key must be unique for each element in the collection, however, or children and local state
 * might be reused in unintended ways.
 *
 * For instance, consider the following example:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.NotAlwaysUniqueKeys
 *
 * This example assumes that `parent.id` is a unique key for each item in the collection,
 * but this is only true if it is fair to assume that a parent will only ever have a single child,
 * which may not be the case.  Instead, it may be more correct to do the following:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.MoreCorrectUniqueKeys
 *
 * A compound key can be created by passing in multiple arguments:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.TwoInputsKeySample
 *
 * @param keys The set of values to be used to create a compound key. These will be compared to
 * their previous values using [equals] and [hashCode]
 * @param block The composable children for this group.
