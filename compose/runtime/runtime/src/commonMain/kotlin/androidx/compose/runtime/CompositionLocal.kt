/**
 * Compose passes data through the composition tree explicitly through means of parameters to
 * composable functions. This is often times the simplest and best way to have data flow through
 * the tree.
 *
 * Sometimes this model can be cumbersome or break down for data that is needed by lots of
 * components, or when components need to pass data between one another but keep that implementation
 * detail private. For these cases, [CompositionLocal]s can be used as an implicit way to have data
 * flow through a composition.
 *
 * [CompositionLocal]s by their nature are hierarchical. They make sense when the value of the
 * [CompositionLocal] needs to be scoped to a particular sub-hierarchy of the composition.
 *
 * One must create a [CompositionLocal] instance, which can be referenced by the consumers
 * statically. [CompositionLocal] instances themselves hold no data, and can be thought of as a
 * type-safe identifier for the data being passed down a tree. [CompositionLocal] factory functions
 * take a single parameter: a factory to create a default value in cases where a [CompositionLocal]
 * is used without a Provider. If this is a situation you would rather not handle, you can throw
 * an error in this factory.
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.createCompositionLocal
 *
 * Somewhere up the tree, a [CompositionLocalProvider] component can be used, which provides a
 * value for the [CompositionLocal]. This would often be at the "root" of a tree, but could be
 * anywhere, and can also be used in multiple places to override the provided value for a sub-tree.
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.compositionLocalProvider
 *
 * Intermediate components do not need to know about the [CompositionLocal] value, and can have zero
 * dependencies on it. For example, `SomeScreen` might look like this:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.someScreenSample
 *
 * Finally, a component that wishes to consume the [CompositionLocal] value can use the [current]
 * property of the [CompositionLocal] key which returns the current value of the
 * [CompositionLocal], and subscribes the component to changes of it.
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.consumeCompositionLocal
