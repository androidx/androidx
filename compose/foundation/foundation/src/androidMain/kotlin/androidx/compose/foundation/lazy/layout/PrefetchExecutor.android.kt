/**
 * Android specific prefetch implementation. The only platform specific things are:
 * 1) Calculating the deadline
 * 2) Posting the delayed runnable
 * This could be refactored in the future in order to keep the most logic platform agnostic to
 * enable the prefetching on desktop.
 *
 * The differences with the implementation in RecyclerView:
 *
 * 1) Prefetch is per-list-index, and performed on whole item.
 *    With RecyclerView, nested scrolling RecyclerViews would prefetch incrementally, e.g. items
 *    like the following in a scrolling vertical list could be broken up within a frame:
 *    [Row1 [a], [b], [c]]
 *    [Row2 [d], [e]]
 *    [Row3 [f], [g], [h]]
 *    You could have frames that break up this work arbitrarily:
 *    Frame 1 - prefetch [a]
 *    Frame 2 - prefetch [b], [c]
 *    Frame 3 - prefetch [d]
 *    Frame 4 - prefetch [e], [f]
 *    Something similar is not possible with LazyColumn yet.
 *
 * 2) Prefetching time estimation only captured during the prefetch.
 *    We currently don't track the time of the regular subcompose call happened during the regular
 *    measure pass, only the ones which are done during the prefetching. The downside is we build
 *    our prefetch information only after scrolling has started and items are showing up. Your very
 *    first scroll won't know if it's safe to prefetch. Why:
 *    a) SubcomposeLayout is not exposing an API to understand if subcompose() call is going to
 *    do the real work. The work could be skipped if the same lambda was passed as for the
 *    previous invocation or if there were no recompositions scheduled. We could workaround it
 *    by keeping the extra state in LazyListState about what items we already composed and to
 *    only measure the first composition for the given slot, or consider exposing extra
 *    information in SubcomposeLayoutState API.
 *    b) It allows us to nicely decouple the logic, now the prefetching logic is build on
 *    top of the regular LazyColumn measuring functionallity and the main logic knows nothing
 *    about prefetch
 *    c) Maybe the better approach would be to wait till the low-level runtime infra is ready to
 *    do subcompositions on the different threads which illuminates the need to calculate the
 *    deadlines completely.
 *    Tracking bug: b/187393381.
 *
 * 3) Prefetch is not aware of item type.
 *    RecyclerView separates timing metadata about different item types. For example, in play
 *    store style UI, this allows RecyclerView to separately estimate the cost of a header,
 *    separator, and item row. In this implementation, all of these would be averaged together in
 *    the same estimation.
 *    There is no view type concept in LazyColumn at all. What can we possible do:
 *    a) Think of different item/items calls in the builder dsl as different view types
 *    automatically. It is close enough but still not entirely correct if the user have something
 *    like a list of elements which are objects of some sealed classes and they consider
 *    different classes as completely different types
 *    b) Maybe if we would be able to precompose on the different thread this issue is also not
 *    so critical given that we don't need to calculate the deadline.
 *    Tracking bug: 187393922
