         * DragAndDrop's own callbacks do not work well with nested content. Simply, when B is

         * when the item moves over B.
         *
         * This variable counts the difference between number of times enter and exit are called,
         * but not just on this node. ReceiveContent chaining makes sure that every enter event
         * that B receives is also delegated A. For example;
         *
         * - Dragging item moves onto A.
         *   - A receives an enter event from DragAndDrop system. Enter=1, Exit=0
         * - Dragging item moves onto B.
         *   - A receives an exit event from DragAndDrop system. Enter=1, Exit=1.
         *   - B receives an enter event from DragAndDrop system.
         *     - B delegates this to A.
         *     - A receives an enter event from B. Enter=2, Exit=1
         *
         * In conclusion, nodeEnterCount would be 1, meaning that this node is still hovered.
