/**
 * The DSL implementation of a lazy grid layout. It composes only visible rows of the grid.
 * This API is not stable, please consider using stable components like [LazyColumn] and [Row]
 * to achieve the same result.
 *
 * Sample:
 * @sample androidx.compose.foundation.samples.LazyVerticalGridSample
 *
 * Sample with custom item spans:
 * @sample androidx.compose.foundation.samples.LazyVerticalGridSpanSample
 *
 * @param cells a class describing how cells form columns, see [GridCells] doc for more information
 * @param modifier the modifier to apply to this layout
 * @param state the state object to be used to control or observe the list's state
 * @param contentPadding specify a padding around the whole content
 * @param reverseLayout reverse the direction of scrolling and layout, when `true` items will be
 * composed from the end to the start and [LazyGridState.firstVisibleItemIndex] == 0 will mean
 * the first item is located at the end.
 * @param verticalArrangement The vertical arrangement of the layout's children
 * @param horizontalArrangement The horizontal arrangement of the layout's children
 * @param flingBehavior logic describing fling behavior
 * @param userScrollEnabled whether the scrolling via the user gestures or accessibility actions
 * is allowed. You can still scroll programmatically using the state even when it is disabled.
 * @param content the [LazyListScope] which describes the content
