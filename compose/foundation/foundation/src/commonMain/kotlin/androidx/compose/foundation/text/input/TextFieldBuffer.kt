 * A text buffer that can be edited, similar to [StringBuilder].
 *
 * This class provides methods for changing the text, such as:
 *  - [replace]
 *  - [append]
 *  - [insert]
 *  - [delete]
 *
 * This class also stores and tracks the cursor position or selection range. The cursor position is
 * just a selection range with zero length. The cursor and selection can be changed using methods
 * such as:
 *  - [placeCursorAfterCharAt]
 *  - [placeCursorBeforeCharAt]
 *  - [placeCursorAtEnd]
 *  - [selectAll]
 *
 * To get one of these, and for usage samples, see [TextFieldState.edit]. Every change to the buffer
 * is tracked in a [ChangeList] which you can access via the [changes] property.
