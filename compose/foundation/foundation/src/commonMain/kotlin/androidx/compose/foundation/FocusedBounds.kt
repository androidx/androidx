/**
 * Calls [onPositioned] whenever the bounds of the currently-focused area changes.
 * If a child of this node has focus, [onPositioned] will be called immediately with a non-null
 * [LayoutCoordinates] that can be queried for the focused bounds, and again every time the focused
 * child changes or is repositioned. When a child loses focus, [onPositioned] will be passed `null`.
 *
 * When an event occurs, it is bubbled up from the focusable node, so the nearest parent gets the
 * event first, and then its parent, etc.
 *
 * Note that there may be some cases where the focused bounds change but the callback is _not_
 * invoked, but the last [LayoutCoordinates] will always return the most up-to-date bounds.
