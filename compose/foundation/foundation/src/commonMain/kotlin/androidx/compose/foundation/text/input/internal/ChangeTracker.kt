     * This function deals with three "coordinate spaces":
     *  - `original`: The text before any changes were made.
     *  - `pre`: The text before this change is applied, but with all previous changes applied.
     *  - `post`: The text after this change is applied, including all the previous changes.
     *
     * When this function is called, the existing changes map ranges in `original` to ranges in
     * `pre`. The new change is a mapping from `pre` to `post`. This function must determine the
     * corresponding range in `original` for this change, and convert all other changes' `pre`
     * ranges to `post`. It must also ensure that any adjacent or overlapping ranges are merged to
     * ensure the [ChangeList] invariant that all changes are non-overlapping.
     *
     * The algorithm works as follows:
     *  1. Find all the changes that are adjacent to or overlap with this one. This search is
     *     performed in the `pre` space since that's the space the new change shares with the
     *     existing changes.
     *  2. Merge all the changes from (1) into a single range in the `original` and `pre` spaces.
     *  3. Merge the new change with the change from (2), updating the end of the range to account
     *     for the new text.
     *  3. Offset all remaining changes are to account for the new text.
