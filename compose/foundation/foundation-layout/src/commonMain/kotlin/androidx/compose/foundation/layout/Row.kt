/**
 * A layout composable that places its children in a horizontal sequence. For a layout composable
 * that places its children in a vertical sequence, see [Column]. Note that by default items do not
 * scroll; see `Modifier.horizontalScroll` to add this behavior. For a horizontally scrollable list
 * that only composes and lays out the currently visible items see `LazyRow`.
 *
 * The [Row] layout is able to assign children widths according to their weights provided using the
 * [RowScope.weight] modifier. If a child is not provided a weight, it will be asked for its
 * preferred width before the sizes of the children with weights are calculated proportionally to
 * their weight based on the remaining available space. Note that if the [Row] is horizontally
 * scrollable or part of a horizontally scrollable container, any provided weights will be
 * disregarded as the remaining available space will be infinite.
 *
 * When none of its children have weights, a [Row] will be as small as possible to fit its children
 * one next to the other. In order to change the width of the [Row], use the [Modifier.width]
 * modifiers; e.g. to make it fill the available width [Modifier.fillMaxWidth] can be used. If at
 * least one child of a [Row] has a [weight][RowScope.weight], the [Row] will fill the available
 * width, so there is no need for [Modifier.fillMaxWidth]. However, if [Row]'s size should be
 * limited, the [Modifier.width] or [Modifier.size] layout modifiers should be applied.
 *
 * When the size of the [Row] is larger than the sum of its children sizes, a
 * [horizontalArrangement] can be specified to define the positioning of the children inside the
 * [Row]. See [Arrangement] for available positioning behaviors; a custom arrangement can also be
 * defined using the constructor of [Arrangement]. Below is an illustration of different horizontal
 * arrangements:
 *
 * ![Row
 * arrangements](https://developer.android.com/images/reference/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/row_arrangement_visualization.gif)
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.foundation.layout.samples.SimpleRow
 *
 * Note that if two or more Text components are placed in a [Row], normally they should be aligned
 * by their first baselines. [Row] as a general purpose container does not do it automatically so
 * developers need to handle this manually. This is achieved by adding a [RowScope.alignByBaseline]
 * modifier to every such Text component. By default this modifier aligns by [FirstBaseline]. If,
 * however, you need to align Texts by [LastBaseline] for example, use a more general
 * [RowScope.alignBy] modifier.
 *
 * See example of using Texts inside the Row:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.foundation.layout.samples.SimpleAlignByInRow
 * @param modifier The modifier to be applied to the Row.
 * @param horizontalArrangement The horizontal arrangement of the layout's children.
 * @param verticalAlignment The vertical alignment of the layout's children.
 * @see Column
 * @see [androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyRow]
