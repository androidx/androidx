/**
 * A composable that defines its own content according to the available space, based on the incoming
 * constraints or the current [LayoutDirection].
 * Example usage:
 * @sample androidx.compose.foundation.layout.samples.BoxWithConstraintsSample
 *
 * The composable will compose the given children, and will position the resulting layout
 * elements in a parent layout which behaves similar to a [Box].
 * The layout will size itself to fit the content, subject to the incoming constraints.
 * When children are smaller than the parent, by default they will be positioned inside
 * the layout according to the [contentAlignment]. For individually specifying the alignments
 * of the children layouts, use the [BoxScope.align] modifier.
 * By default, the content will be measured without the [Box]'s incoming min constraints,
 * unless [propagateMinConstraints] is `true`. As an example, setting [propagateMinConstraints] to
 * `true` can be useful when the [BoxWithConstraints] has content on which modifiers cannot be
 * specified directly and setting a min size on the content of the [BoxWithConstraints] is needed.
 * If [propagateMinConstraints] is set to `true`, the min size set on the [BoxWithConstraints] will
 * also be applied to the content, whereas otherwise the min size will only apply to the
 * [BoxWithConstraints].
 * When the content has more than one layout child the layout children will be stacked one
 * on top of the other (positioned as explained above) in the composition order.
 *
 * @param modifier Modifier to be applied to the layout.
 * @param contentAlignment The default alignment inside the [BoxWithConstraints].
 * @param propagateMinConstraints Whether the incoming min constraints should be passed to content.
 * @param content The content of the [BoxWithConstraints].
