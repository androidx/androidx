/**
 * A layout composable that places its children in a vertical sequence. For a layout composable
 * that places its children in a horizontal sequence, see [Row]. Note that by default items do
 * not scroll; see `Modifier.verticalScroll` to add this behavior. For a vertically
 * scrollable list that only composes and lays out the currently visible items see `LazyColumn`.
 *
 * The [Column] layout is able to assign children heights according to their weights provided
 * using the [ColumnScope.weight] modifier. If a child is not provided a weight, it will be
 * asked for its preferred height before the sizes of the children with weights are calculated
 * proportionally to their weight based on the remaining available space. Note that if the
 * [Column] is vertically scrollable or part of a vertically scrollable container, any provided
 * weights will be disregarded as the remaining available space will be infinite.
 *
 * When none of its children have weights, a [Column] will be as small as possible to fit its
 * children one on top of the other. In order to change the height of the [Column], use the
 * [Modifier.height] modifiers; e.g. to make it fill the available height [Modifier.fillMaxHeight]
 * can be used. If at least one child of a [Column] has a [weight][ColumnScope.weight], the [Column]
 * will fill the available height, so there is no need for [Modifier.fillMaxHeight]. However, if
 * [Column]'s size should be limited, the [Modifier.height] or [Modifier.size] layout modifiers
 * should be applied.
 *
 * When the size of the [Column] is larger than the sum of its children sizes, a
 * [verticalArrangement] can be specified to define the positioning of the children inside the
 * [Column]. See [Arrangement] for available positioning behaviors; a custom arrangement can also
 * be defined using the constructor of [Arrangement]. Below is an illustration of different
 * vertical arrangements:
 *
 * ![Column arrangements](https://developer.android.com/images/reference/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/column_arrangement_visualization.gif)
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.foundation.layout.samples.SimpleColumn
 *
 * @param modifier The modifier to be applied to the Column.
 * @param verticalArrangement The vertical arrangement of the layout's children.
 * @param horizontalAlignment The horizontal alignment of the layout's children.
 *
 * @see Row
 * @see [androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyColumn]
