 * @param interactionSource the [MutableInteractionSource] representing the stream of
 * [Interaction]s for this Card. You can create and pass in your own remembered
 * [MutableInteractionSource] if you want to observe [Interaction]s and customize the appearance
 * / behavior of this card in different [Interaction]s.
 * @param indication indication to be shown when card is pressed. By default, indication from
 * [LocalIndication] will be used. Pass `null` to show no indication, or current value from
 * [LocalIndication] to show theme default
 * @param enabled Controls the enabled state of the card. When `false`, this card will not
 * be clickable
 * @param onClickLabel semantic / accessibility label for the [onClick] action
 * @param role the type of user interface element. Accessibility services might use this
 * to describe the element or do customizations. For example, if the Card acts as a button, you
