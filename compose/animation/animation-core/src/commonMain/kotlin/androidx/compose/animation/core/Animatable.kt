/**
 * [Animatable] is a value holder that automatically animates its value when the value is
 * changed via [animateTo]. If [animateTo] is invoked during an ongoing value change animation,
 * a new animation will transition [Animatable] from its current value (i.e. value at the point of
 * interruption) to the new [targetValue]. This ensures that the value change is __always__
 * continuous using [animateTo]. If a [spring] animation (e.g. default animation) is used with
 * [animateTo], the velocity change will guarantee to be continuous as well.
 *
 * Unlike [AnimationState], [Animatable] ensures *mutual exclusiveness* on its animations. To
 * achieve this, when a new animation is started via [animateTo] (or [animateDecay]), any ongoing
 * animation will be canceled via a [CancellationException].
