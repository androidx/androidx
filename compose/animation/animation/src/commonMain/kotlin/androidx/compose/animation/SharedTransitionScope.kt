     *
     * While the shared elements are rendered in overlay during the transition, its
     * [zIndexInOverlay] can be specified to allow shared elements to render in a different order
     * than their placement/zOrder when not in the overlay. For example, the title of a page is
     * typically placed and rendered before the content below. During the transition, it may be
     * desired to animate the title over on top of the other shared elements on that page to
     * indicate significance or a point of interest. [zIndexInOverlay] can be used to facilitate
     * such use cases. [zIndexInOverlay] is 0f by default.
     *
     * [renderInOverlayDuringTransition] is true by default. In some rare use cases, there may

    /**
     * [sharedElementWithCallerManagedVisibility] is a modifier that tags a layout with a
     * [SharedContentState.key], such that
     * entering and exiting shared elements of the same key share the animated and continuously
     * changing bounds during the layout change. The bounds will be animated from the initial
     * bounds defined by the exiting shared element to the target bounds calculated based on the
     * incoming shared element. The animation for the bounds can be customized using
     * [boundsTransform].
     *
     * Compared to [sharedElement], [sharedElementWithCallerManagedVisibility] is designed
     * for shared element transitions where the shared element is not a part of the content that
     * is being animated out by [AnimatedVisibility]. Therefore, it is the caller's responsibility
     * to explicitly remove the exiting shared element (i.e. shared elements where
     * [visible] == false) from the tree as appropriate. Typically this is when the transition is
     * finished (i.e. [SharedTransitionScope.isTransitionActive] == false). The target bounds is
     * derived from the [sharedElementWithCallerManagedVisibility] with [visible] being true.
     *
     * In contrast to [sharedBounds], this modifier is intended for shared content that has the
     * exact match in terms of visual content and layout when the measure constraints are the same.
     * Such examples include image assets, icons,
     * [MovableContent][androidx.compose.runtime.MovableContent] etc.
     * Only the shared element that is becoming visible will be rendered during the
     * transition.
     *
     * **Important**:
     * When a shared element finds its match and starts a transition, it will be rendered into
     * the overlay of the [SharedTransitionScope] in order to avoid being faded in/out along with
     * its parents or clipped by its parent as it transforms to the target size and position. This
     * also means that any clipping or fading for the shared elements will need to be applied
     * _explicitly_ as the child of [sharedElementWithCallerManagedVisibility]
     * (i.e. after [sharedElementWithCallerManagedVisibility] modifier in the
     * modifier chain). For example:
     * ```
     * Modifier.sharedElementWithCallerManagedVisibility(...)
     *         .clip(shape = RoundedCornerShape(20.dp))
     * ```
     *
     * By default, the [sharedElementWithCallerManagedVisibility] is clipped by the
     * [clipInOverlayDuringTransition] of its
     * parent [sharedBounds]. If the [sharedElementWithCallerManagedVisibility] has no parent
     * [sharedBounds] or if the parent [sharedBounds] has no clipping defined, it'll not be
     * clipped. If additional clipping is desired to ensure
     * [sharedElementWithCallerManagedVisibility] doesn't move outside of a visual bounds,
     * [clipInOverlayDuringTransition] can be used to specify the clipping for when the shared
     * element is going through an active transition towards a new target bounds.
     *
     * While the shared elements are rendered in overlay during the transition, its
     * [zIndexInOverlay] can be specified to allow shared elements to render in a different order
     * than their placement/zOrder when not in the overlay. For example, the title of a page is
     * typically placed and rendered before the content below. During the transition, it may be
     * desired to animate the title over on top of the other shared elements on that page to
     * indicate significance or a point of interest. [zIndexInOverlay] can be used to facilitate
     * such use cases. [zIndexInOverlay] is 0f by default.
     *
     * [renderInOverlayDuringTransition] is true by default. In some rare use cases, there may
     * be no clipping or layer transform (fade, scale, etc) in the application that prevents
     * shared elements from transitioning from one bounds to another without any clipping or
     * sudden alpha change. In such cases, [renderInOverlayDuringTransition] could be specified
     * to false.
