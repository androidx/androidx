/**
 * This class is used by Compose Desktop Intellij plugin
 * for the non-interactive preview functionality.
 *
 * The class is used via reflection.
 *
 * The non-interactive preview for desktop works in the following way:
 * 1. A user annotates a composable function with the @Preview annotation;
 * 2. A user is able to request an IDE preview by clicking a gutter icon in the editor;
 * 3. When an updated preview is requested, the Intellij plugin requests a fresh build from Gradle
 *    and pulls an updated preview configuration from the build;
 * 4. The IDE plugin manages a separate preview host process;
 * 5. The IDE plugin requests a new frame from the preview host process, when needed (either when
 *    a user requests it explicitly or by resizing the preview tool window);
 * 6. When the preview process receives a preview request, it renders a new frame using this
 *    facade in an isolated classloader via reflection. The classloader is persisted between
 *    requests to minimize render time. Currently it is reused only if there are no changes in a
 *    preview classpath (a requested preview function or a requested frame size may differ).
 * 7. A rendered frame is sent back to the IDE plugin and is shown in the IDE as an image.
