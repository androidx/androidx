/**
 * A strategy for managing the underlying Composition of Compose UI [View]s such as
 * [ComposeView] and [AbstractComposeView]. See [AbstractComposeView.setViewCompositionStrategy].
 *
 * Compose views involve ongoing work and registering the composition with external
 * event sources. These registrations can cause the composition to remain live and
 * ineligible for garbage collection for long after the host View may have been abandoned.
 * These resources and registrations can be released manually at any time by calling
 * [AbstractComposeView.disposeComposition] and a new composition will be created automatically
 * when needed. A [ViewCompositionStrategy] defines a strategy for disposing the composition
 * automatically at an appropriate time.
 *
 * By default, Compose UI views are configured to [Default].
