/**
 * Composes an Android [View] obtained from [factory]. The [factory] block will be called exactly
 * once to obtain the [View] being composed, and it is also guaranteed to be invoked on the UI
 * thread. Therefore, in addition to creating the [View], the [factory] block can also be used to
 * perform one-off initializations and [View] constant properties' setting. The [update] block can
 * run multiple times (on the UI thread as well) due to recomposition, and it is the right place to
 * set the new properties. Note that the block will also run once right after the [factory] block
 * completes.
 *
 * [AndroidView] is commonly needed for using Views that are infeasible to be reimplemented in
 * Compose and there is no corresponding Compose API. Common examples for the moment are
 * WebView, SurfaceView, AdView, etc.
 *
 * This overload of [AndroidView] does not automatically pool or reuse Views. If placed inside of a
 * reusable container (including inside a [LazyRow][androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyRow] or
 * [LazyColumn][androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyColumn]), the View instances will always be
 * discarded and recreated if the composition hierarchy containing the AndroidView changes, even
 * if its group structure did not change and the View could have conceivably been reused.
 *
 * To opt-in for View reuse, call the overload of [AndroidView] that accepts an `onReset` callback,
 * and provide a non-null implementation for this callback. Since it is expensive to discard and
 * recreate View instances, reusing Views can lead to noticeable performance improvements —
 * especially when building a scrolling list of [AndroidViews][AndroidView]. It is highly
 * recommended to opt-in to View reuse when possible.
 *
 * [AndroidView] will not clip its content to the layout bounds. Use [View.setClipToOutline] on
 * the child View to clip the contents, if desired. Developers will likely want to do this with
 * all subclasses of SurfaceView to keep its contents contained.
 *
 * [AndroidView] has nested scroll interop capabilities if the containing view has nested scroll
 * enabled. This means this Composable can dispatch scroll deltas if it is placed inside a
 * container that participates in nested scroll. For more information on how to enable
 * nested scroll interop:
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.ViewInComposeNestedScrollInteropSample
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.AndroidViewSample
 *
 * @param factory The block creating the [View] to be composed.
 * @param modifier The modifier to be applied to the layout.
 * @param update A callback to be invoked after the layout is inflated and upon recomposition to
 * update the information and state of the view.

 *
 * [AndroidView] is commonly needed for using Views that are infeasible to be reimplemented in
 * Compose and there is no corresponding Compose API. Common examples for the moment are
 * WebView, SurfaceView, AdView, etc.
 *
 * By default, [AndroidView] does not automatically pool or reuse Views. If placed inside of a
 * reusable container (including inside a [LazyRow][androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyRow] or
 * [LazyColumn][androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyColumn]), the View instances will always be
 * discarded and recreated if the composition hierarchy containing the AndroidView changes, even
 * if its group structure did not change and the View could have conceivably been reused.
 *
 * Views are eligible for reuse if [AndroidView] is given a non-null [onReset] callback. Since
 * it is expensive to discard and recreate View instances, reusing Views can lead to noticeable
 * performance improvements — especially when building a scrolling list of
 * [AndroidViews][AndroidView]. It is highly recommended to specify an [onReset] implementation and
 * opt-in to View reuse when possible.
 *
 * When [onReset] is specified, [View] instances may be reused when hosted inside of a container
 * that supports reusable elements. Reuse occurs when compatible instances of [AndroidView] are
 * inserted and removed during recomposition. Two instances of `AndroidView` are considered
 * compatible if they are invoked with the same composable group structure. The most common
 * scenario where this happens is in lazy layout APIs like `LazyRow` and `LazyColumn`, which
 * can reuse layout nodes (and Views, in this case) between items when scrolling.
 *
 * [onReset] is invoked on the UI thread when the View will be reused, signaling that the View
 * should be prepared to appear in a new context in the composition hierarchy. This callback
 * is invoked before [update] and may be used to reset any transient View state like animations or
 * user input.
 *
 * Note that [onReset] may not be immediately followed by a call to [update]. Compose may
 * temporarily detach the View from the composition hierarchy if it is deactivated but not released
 * from composition. This can happen if the View appears in a [ReusableContentHost] that is not
 * currently active or inside of a [movable content][androidx.compose.runtime.movableContentOf]
 * block that is being moved. If this happens, the View will be removed from its parent, but
 * retained by Compose so that it may be reused if its content host becomes active again. If the
 * View never becomes active again and is instead discarded entirely, the [onReset] callback will
 * be invoked directly from this deactivated state when Compose releases the View.
 *
 * If you need to observe whether the View is currently used in the composition hierarchy, you may
 * observe whether it is attached via [View.addOnAttachStateChangeListener]. The View may also
 * observe the lifecycle of its host via [findViewTreeLifecycleOwner]. The lifecycle returned by
 * this function will match the [LocalLifecycleOwner]. Note that the lifecycle is not set and cannot
 * be used until the View is attached.
 *
 * When the View is removed from the composition permanently, [onRelease] will be invoked (also on
 * the UI thread). Once this callback returns, Compose will never attempt to reuse the previous
 * View instance regardless of whether an [onReset] implementation was provided. If the View is
 * needed again in the future, a new instance will be created, with a fresh lifecycle that begins
 * by calling the [factory].
 *
 * [AndroidView] will not clip its content to the layout bounds. Use [View.setClipToOutline] on
 * the child View to clip the contents, if desired. Developers will likely want to do this with
 * all subclasses of SurfaceView to keep its contents contained.
 *
 * [AndroidView] has nested scroll interop capabilities if the containing view has nested scroll
 * enabled. This means this Composable can dispatch scroll deltas if it is placed inside a
 * container that participates in nested scroll. For more information on how to enable
 * nested scroll interop:

 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.ReusableAndroidViewInLazyColumnSample
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.AndroidViewWithReleaseSample
 *
 * @param factory The block creating the [View] to be composed.
 * @param modifier The modifier to be applied to the layout.
 * @param onReset A callback invoked as a signal that the view is about to be attached to the
 * composition hierarchy in a different context than its original creation. This callback is invoked
 * before [update] and should prepare the view for general reuse. If `null` or not specified, the
 * `AndroidView` instance will not support reuse, and the View instance will always be discarded
 * whenever the AndroidView is moved or removed from the composition hierarchy.
 * @param onRelease A callback invoked as a signal that this view instance has exited the
 * composition hierarchy entirely and will not be reused again. Any additional resources used by the
 * View should be freed at this time.
 * @param update A callback to be invoked after the layout is inflated and upon recomposition to
 * update the information and state of the view.
