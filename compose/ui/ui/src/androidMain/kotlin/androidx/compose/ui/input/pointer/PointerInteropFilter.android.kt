/**
 * A special PointerInputModifier that provides access to the underlying [MotionEvent]s originally
 * dispatched to Compose. Prefer [pointerInput] and use this only for interoperation with
 * existing code that consumes [MotionEvent]s.
 *
 * While the main intent of this Modifier is to allow arbitrary code to access the original
 * [MotionEvent] dispatched to Compose, for completeness, analogs are provided to allow arbitrary
 * code to interact with the system as if it were an Android View.
 *
 * This includes 2 APIs,
 *
 * 1. [onTouchEvent] has a Boolean return type which is akin to the return type of
 * [View.onTouchEvent]. If the provided [onTouchEvent] returns true, it will continue to receive
 * the event stream (unless the event stream has been intercepted) and if it returns false, it will
 * not.
 *
 * 2. [requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent] is a lambda that you can optionally provide so that
 * you can later call it (yes, in this case, you call the lambda that you provided) which is akin
 * to calling [ViewParent.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent]. When this is called, any
 * associated ancestors in the tree that abide by the contract will act accordingly and will not
 * intercept the even stream.
 *
 * @see [View.onTouchEvent]
 * @see [ViewParent.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent]

/**
 * The stateful part of pointerInteropFilter that manages the interop with Android.
 *
 * The intent of this PointerInputModifier is to allow Android Views and PointerInputModifiers to
 * interact seamlessly despite the differences in the 2 systems. Below is a detailed explanation
 * for how the interop is accomplished.
 *
 * When the type of event is not a movement event, we dispatch to the Android View as soon as
 * possible (during [PointerEventPass.Initial]) so that the Android View can react to down
 * and up events before Compose PointerInputModifiers normally would.
 *
 * When the type of event is a movement event, we dispatch to the Android View during
 * [PointerEventPass.Final] to allow Compose PointerInputModifiers to react to movement first,
 * which mimics a parent [ViewGroup] intercepting the event stream.
 *
 * Whenever we are about to call [onTouchEvent], we check to see if anything in Compose
 * consumed any aspect of the pointer input changes, and if they did, we intercept the stream and
 * dispatch ACTION_CANCEL to the Android View if they have already returned true for a call to
 * View#dispatchTouchEvent(...).
 *
 * If we do call [onTouchEvent], and it returns true, we consume all of the changes so that
 * nothing in Compose also responds.
 *
 * If the [requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent] is provided and called with true, we simply dispatch move
 * events during [PointerEventPass.Initial] so that normal PointerInputModifiers don't get a
 * chance to consume first.  Note:  This does mean that it is possible for a Compose
 * PointerInputModifier to "intercept" even after requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent has been
 * called because consumption can occur during [PointerEventPass.Initial].  This may seem
 * like a flaw, but in reality, any PointerInputModifier that consumes that aggressively would
 * likely only do so after some consumption already occurred on a later pass, and this ability to
 * do so is on par with a [ViewGroup]'s ability to override [ViewGroup.dispatchTouchEvent]
 * instead of overriding the more usual [ViewGroup.onTouchEvent] and [ViewGroup
 * .onInterceptTouchEvent].
 *
 * If [requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent] is later called with false (the Android equivalent of
 * calling [ViewParent.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent] is exceedingly rare), we revert back to
 * the normal behavior.
 *
 * If all pointers go up on the pointer interop filter, parents will be set to be allowed to
 * intercept when new pointers go down. [requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent] must be called again to
 * change that state.
