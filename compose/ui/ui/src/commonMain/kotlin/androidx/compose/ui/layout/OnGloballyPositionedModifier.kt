 * Note that it will be called **after** a composition when the coordinates are finalized.
 *
 * This callback will be invoked at least once when the [LayoutCoordinates] are available, and every
 * time the element's position changes within the window. However, it is not guaranteed to be
 * invoked every time the position _relative to the screen_ of the modified element changes. For
 * example, the system may move the contents inside a window around without firing a callback.
 * If you are using the [LayoutCoordinates] to calculate position on the screen, and not just inside
 * the window, you may not receive a callback.
