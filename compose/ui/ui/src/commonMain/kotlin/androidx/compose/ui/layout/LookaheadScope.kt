/**
 * Creates an approach layout intended to help gradually approach the destination layout calculated
 * in the lookahead pass. This can be particularly helpful when the destination layout is
 * anticipated to change drastically and would consequently result in visual disruptions.
 *
 * In order to create a smooth approach, an interpolation (often through animations) can be used
 * in [approachMeasure] to interpolate the measurement or placement from a previously recorded size
 * and/or position to the destination/target size and/or position. The destination size is
 * available in [ApproachMeasureScope] as [ApproachMeasureScope.lookaheadSize]. And the target
 * position can also be acquired in [ApproachMeasureScope] during placement by using
 * [LookaheadScope.localLookaheadPositionOf] with the layout's
 * [Placeable.PlacementScope.coordinates]. The sample code below illustrates how that can be
 * achieved.
 *
 * [isMeasurementApproachInProgress] signals whether the measurement is in progress of approaching
 * destination size. It will be queried after the destination has been determined by the lookahead
 * pass, before [approachMeasure] is invoked. The lookahead size is provided to
 * [isMeasurementApproachInProgress] for convenience in deciding whether the destination size has
 * been reached.
 *
 * [isMeasurementApproachInProgress] indicates whether the position is currently approaching
 * destination defined by the lookahead, hence it's a signal to the system for whether additional
 * approach placements are necessary. [isPlacementApproachInProgress] will be invoked after the
 * destination position has been determined by lookahead pass, and before the placement phase in
 * [approachMeasure].
 *
 * Once both [isMeasurementApproachInProgress] and [isPlacementApproachInProgress] return false, the
 * system may skip approach pass until additional approach passes are necessary as indicated by
 * [isMeasurementApproachInProgress] and [isPlacementApproachInProgress].
 *
 * **IMPORTANT**:
 * It is important to be accurate in [isPlacementApproachInProgress] and
 * [isMeasurementApproachInProgress]. A prolonged indication of incomplete approach will prevent the
 * system from potentially skipping approach pass when possible.
 *
 * @see ApproachLayoutModifierNode
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.approachLayoutSample
