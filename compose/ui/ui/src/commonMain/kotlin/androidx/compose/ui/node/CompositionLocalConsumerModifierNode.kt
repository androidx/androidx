/**
 * Returns the current value of [local] at the position in the composition hierarchy of this
 * modifier's attached layout node.
 *
 * Unlike [CompositionLocal.current], reads via this function are not automatically tracked by
 * Compose. Modifiers are not able to recompose in the same way that a Composable can, and therefore
 * can't receive updates arbitrarily for a CompositionLocal.
 *
 * Because CompositionLocals may change arbitrarily, it is strongly recommended to ensure that
 * the composition local is observed instead of being read once. If you call [currentValueOf]
 * inside of a modifier callback like [LayoutModifierNode.measure] or [DrawModifierNode.draw],
 * then Compose will track the CompositionLocal read. This happens automatically, because these
 * Compose UI phases take place in a snapshot observer that tracks which states are read. If the
 * value of the CompositionLocal changes, and it was read inside of the measure or draw phase,
 * then that phase will automatically be invalidated.
 *
 * For all other reads of a CompositionLocal, this function will **not** notify you when the
 * value of the local changes. [Modifier.Node] classes that also implement [ObserverModifierNode]
 * may observe CompositionLocals arbitrarily by performing the lookup in an [observeReads] block.
 * To continue observing values of the CompositionLocal, it must be read again in an [observeReads]
 * block during or after the [ObserverModifierNode.onObservedReadsChanged] callback is invoked. See
 * below for an example of how to implement this observation pattern.
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.CompositionLocalConsumingModifierObserverNodeSample
 *
 * This function will fail with an [IllegalStateException] if you attempt to read a CompositionLocal
 * before the node is [attached][Modifier.Node.onAttach] or after the node is
 * [detached][Modifier.Node.onDetach].
 *
 * @param local The CompositionLocal to get the current value of
 * @return The value provided by the nearest [CompositionLocalProvider] component that
 * invokes, directly or indirectly, the composable function that this modifier is attached to.
 * If [local] was never provided, its default value will be returned instead.
