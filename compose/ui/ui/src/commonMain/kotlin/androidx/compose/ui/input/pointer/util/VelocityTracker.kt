 * Initial condition is discussed below, but for now suppose that v(t=0) = 0
 *
 * The kinetic energy of the object at the release is E=0.5*m*v^2
 * Then vfinal = sqrt(2E/m). The goal is to calculate E.
 *
 * The kinetic energy at the release is equal to the total work done on the object by the finger.
 * The total work W is the sum of all dW along the path.
 *
 * dW = F*dx, where dx is the piece of path traveled.
 * Force is change of momentum over time, F = dp/dt = m dv/dt.
 * Then substituting:
 * dW = m (dv/dt) * dx = m * v * dv
 *
 * Summing along the path, we get:
 * W = sum(dW) = sum(m * v * dv) = m * sum(v * dv)
 * Since the mass stays constant, the equation for final velocity is:
 * vfinal = sqrt(2*sum(v * dv))
 *
 * Here,
 * dv : change of velocity = (v[i+1]-v[i])
 * dx : change of distance = (x[i+1]-x[i])
 * dt : change of time = (t[i+1]-t[i])
 * v : instantaneous velocity = dx/dt
 *
 * The final formula is:
 * vfinal = sqrt(2) * sqrt(sum((v[i]-v[i-1])*|v[i]|)) for all i
 * The absolute value is needed to properly account for the sign. If the velocity over a
 * particular segment decreases, then this indicates braking, which means that negative
 * work was done. So for two positive, but decreasing, velocities, this contribution would be
 * negative and will cause a smaller final velocity.
 *
 * Initial condition
 * There are two ways to deal with initial condition:
 * 1) Assume that v(0) = 0, which would mean that the subject is initially at rest.
 * This is not entirely accurate. We are only taking the past X ms of touch data, where X is
 * currently equal to 100. However, a touch event that created a fling probably lasted for longer
 * than that, which would mean that the user has already been interacting with the subject, and
 * it has probably already been moving.
 * 2) Assume that the subject has already been moving at a certain velocity, calculate this
 * initial velocity and the equivalent energy, and start with this initial energy.
 * Consider an example where we have the following data, consisting of 3 points:
 *                 time: t0, t1, t2
 *                 x   : x0, x1, x2
 *                 v   :  0, v1, v2
 * Here is what will happen in each of these scenarios:
 * 1) By directly applying the formula above with the v(0) = 0 boundary condition, we will get
 * vfinal = sqrt(2*(|v1|*(v1-v0) + |v2|*(v2-v1))). This can be simplified since v0=0
 * vfinal = sqrt(2*(|v1|*v1 + |v2|*(v2-v1))) = sqrt(2*(v1^2 + |v2|*(v2 - v1)))
 * since velocity is a real number
 * 2) If we treat the subject as already moving, then it must already have an energy (per mass)
 * equal to 1/2*v1^2. Then the initial energy should be 1/2*v1*2, and only the second segment
 * will contribute to the total kinetic energy (since we can effectively consider that v0=v1).
 * This will give the following expression for the final velocity:
 * vfinal = sqrt(2*(1/2*v1^2 + |v2|*(v2-v1)))
 * This analysis can be generalized to an arbitrary number of samples.
 *
 *
 * Comparing the two equations above, we see that the only mathematical difference
 * is the factor of 1/2 in front of the first velocity term.
 * This boundary condition would allow for the "proper" calculation of the case when all of the
 * samples are equally spaced in time and distance, which should suggest a constant velocity.
 *
 * Note that approach 2) is sensitive to the proper ordering of the data in time, since
 * the boundary condition must be applied to the oldest sample to be accurate.
 *
 * NOTE: [sampleCount] MUST be >= 2
