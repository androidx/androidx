/**
 * Opens a dialog with the given content.
 *
 * A dialog is a small window that prompts the user to make a decision or enter
 * additional information. A dialog does not fill the screen and is normally used
 * for modal events that require users to take an action before they can proceed.
 *
 * The dialog is visible as long as it is part of the composition hierarchy.
 * In order to let the user dismiss the Dialog, the implementation of [onDismissRequest] should
 * contain a way to remove the dialog from the composition hierarchy.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.DialogSample
 *
 * @param onDismissRequest Executes when the user tries to dismiss the dialog.
 * @param properties [DialogProperties] for further customization of this dialog's behavior.
 * @param content The content to be displayed inside the dialog.
