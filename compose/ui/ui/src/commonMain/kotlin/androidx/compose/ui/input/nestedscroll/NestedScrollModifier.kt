/**
 * Modify element to make it participate in the nested scrolling hierarchy.
 *
 * There are two ways to participate in the nested scroll: as a scrolling child by dispatching
 * scrolling events via [NestedScrollDispatcher] to the nested scroll chain; and as a member of
 * nested scroll chain by providing [NestedScrollConnection], which will be called when another
 * nested scrolling child below dispatches scrolling events.
 *
 * It's a mandatory to participate as a [NestedScrollConnection] in the chain, but scrolling
 * events dispatch is optional since there are cases when element wants to participate in the
 * nested scroll, but not a scrollable thing itself.
 *
 * Here's the collapsing toolbar example that participates in a chain, but doesn't dispatch:
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.NestedScrollConnectionSample
 *
 * On the other side, dispatch via [NestedScrollDispatcher] is optional. It's needed if a component
 * is able to receive and react to the drag/fling events and you want this components to be able to
 * notify parents when scroll occurs, resulting in better overall coordination.
 *
 * Here's the example of the component that is draggable and dispatches nested scroll to
 * participate in the nested scroll chain:
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.NestedScrollDispatcherSample
 *
 * **Note:** It is recommended to reuse [NestedScrollConnection] and [NestedScrollDispatcher]
 * objects
 * between recompositions since different object will cause nested scroll graph to be
 * recalculated unnecessary.
 *
 * There are 4 main phases in nested scrolling system:
 *
 * 1. Pre-scroll. This callback is triggered when the descendant is about to perform a scroll
 * operation and gives parent an opportunity to consume part of child's delta beforehand. This
 * pass should happen every time scrollable components receives delta and dispatches it via
 * [NestedScrollDispatcher]. Dispatching child should take into account how much all ancestors
 * above the hierarchy consumed and adjust the consumption accordingly.
 *
 * 2. Post-scroll. This callback is triggered when the descendant consumed the delta already
 * (after taking into account what parents pre-consumed in 1.) and wants to notify the ancestors
 * with the amount of delta unconsumed. This pass should happen every time scrollable components
 * receives delta and dispatches it via [NestedScrollDispatcher]. Any parent that receives
 * [NestedScrollConnection.onPostScroll] should consume no more than `left` and return the amount
 * consumed.
 *
 * 3. Pre-fling. Pass that happens when the scrolling descendant stopped dragging and about to
 * fling with the some velocity. This callback allows ancestors to consume part of the velocity.
 * This pass should happen before the fling itself happens. Similar to pre-scroll, parent can
 * consume part of the velocity and nodes below (including the dispatching child) should adjust
 * their logic to accommodate only the velocity left.
 *
 * 4. Post-fling. Pass that happens after the scrolling descendant stopped flinging and wants to
 * notify ancestors about that fact, providing velocity left to consume as a part of this. This
 * pass should happen after the fling itself happens on the scrolling child. Ancestors of the
 * dispatching node will have opportunity to fling themselves with the `velocityLeft` provided.
 * Parent must call `notifySelfFinish` callback in order to continue the propagation of the
 * velocity that is left to ancestors above.
 *
 * [androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyColumn], [androidx.compose.foundation.verticalScroll] and
 * [androidx.compose.foundation.gestures.scrollable] have build in support for nested scrolling,
 * however, it's desirable to be able to react and influence their scroll via nested scroll system.
 *
 * **Note:** The nested scroll system is orientation independent. This mean it is based off the
 * screen direction (x and y coordinates) rather than being locked to a specific orientation.
 *
 * @param connection connection to the nested scroll system to participate in the event chaining,
 * receiving events when scrollable descendant is being scrolled.
 * @param dispatcher object to be attached to the nested scroll system on which `dispatch*`
 * methods can be called to notify ancestors within nested scroll system about scrolling happening
