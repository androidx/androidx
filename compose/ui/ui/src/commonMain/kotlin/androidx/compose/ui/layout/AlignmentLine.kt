/**
 * Defines an offset line that can be used by parent layouts to align and position their children.
 * Text baselines are representative examples of [AlignmentLine]s. For example, they can be used
 * by `Row`, to align its children by baseline, or by `paddingFrom` to achieve a layout
 * with a specific distance from the top to the baseline of the text content. [AlignmentLine]s
 * can be understood as an abstraction over text baselines.
 *
 * When a layout provides a value for a particular [AlignmentLine], this can be read by the
 * parents of the layout after measuring, using the [Placeable.get] operator on the corresponding
 * [Placeable] instance. Based on the position of the [AlignmentLine], the parents can then decide
 * the positioning of the children.
 *
 * Note that when a layout provides a value for an [AlignmentLine], this will be automatically
 * inherited by the layout's parent, which will offset the value by the position of the child
 * within itself. This way, nested layout hierarchies are able to preserve the [AlignmentLine]s
 * defined for deeply nested children, making it possible for non-direct parents to use these for
 * positioning and alignment. When a layout inherits multiple values for the same [AlignmentLine]
 * from different children, the position of the line within the layout will be computed by merging
 * the children values using the provided [merger]. If a layout provides a value for an
 * [AlignmentLine], this will always be the position of the line, regardless of the values
 * provided by children for the same line.
 *
 * [AlignmentLine]s cannot be created directly, please create [VerticalAlignmentLine] or
 * [HorizontalAlignmentLine] instances instead.
