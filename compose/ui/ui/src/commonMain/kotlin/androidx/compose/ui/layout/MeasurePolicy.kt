/**
 * Defines the measure and layout behavior of a [Layout]. [Layout] and [MeasurePolicy] are the way
 * Compose layouts (such as `Box`, `Column`, etc.) are built, and they can also be used to achieve
 * custom layouts.
 *
 * See [Layout] samples for examples of how to use [MeasurePolicy].
 *
 * Intrinsic measurement methods define the intrinsic size of the layout. These can be queried
 * by the layout's parent in order to obtain, in specific cases, more information about
 * the size of the layout in the absence of specific constraints:
 *
 * - [minIntrinsicWidth] defines the minimum width this layout can take, given
 *   a specific height, such that the content of the layout will be painted correctly
 * - [minIntrinsicHeight] defines the minimum height this layout can take, given
 *   a specific width, such that the content of the layout will be painted correctly
 * - [maxIntrinsicWidth] defines the minimum width such that increasing it further
 *   will not decrease the minimum intrinsic height
 * - [maxIntrinsicHeight] defines the minimum height such that increasing it further
 *   will not decrease the minimum intrinsic width
 *
 * Most layout scenarios do not require querying intrinsic measurements. Therefore, when writing
 * a custom layout, it is common to only define the actual measurement, as most of the times
 * the intrinsic measurements of the layout will not be queried. Moreover, intrinsic measurement
 * methods have default implementations that make a best effort attempt to calculate the intrinsic
 * measurements by reusing the [measure] method. Note this will not be correct for all layouts,
 * but can be a convenient approximation.
 *
 * Intrinsic measurements can be useful when the layout system enforcement of no more than one
 * measurement per child is limiting. Layouts that use them are the `preferredWidth(IntrinsicSize)`
 * and `preferredHeight(IntrinsicSize)` modifiers. See their samples for when they can be useful.

    /**
     * The function that defines the measurement and layout. Each [Measurable] in the [measurables]
     * list corresponds to a layout child of the layout, and children can be measured using the
     * [Measurable.measure] method. This method takes the [Constraints] which the child should
     * respect; different children can be measured with different constraints.
     *
     * Measuring a child returns a [Placeable], which reveals the size chosen by the child as a
     * result of its own measurement. According to the children sizes, the parent defines the
     * position of the children, by [placing][Placeable.PlacementScope.place] the [Placeable]s in
     * the [MeasureResult.placeChildren] of the returned [MeasureResult]. Therefore the parent needs
     * to measure its children with appropriate [Constraints], such that whatever valid sizes
     * children choose, they can be laid out correctly according to the parent's layout algorithm.
     * This is because there is no measurement negotiation between the parent and children:
     * once a child chooses its size, the parent needs to handle it correctly.
     *
     * Note that a child is allowed to choose a size that does not satisfy its constraints. However,
     * when this happens, the placeable's [width][Placeable.width] and [height][Placeable.height]
     * will not represent the real size of the child, but rather the size coerced in the
     * child's constraints. Therefore, it is common for parents to assume in their layout
     * algorithm that its children will always respect the constraints. When this
     * does not happen in reality, the position assigned to the child will be
     * automatically offset to be centered on the space assigned by the parent under
     * the assumption that constraints were respected. Rarely, when a parent really needs to know
     * the true size of the child, they can read this from the placeable's
     * [Placeable.measuredWidth] and [Placeable.measuredHeight].
     *
     * [MeasureResult] objects are usually created using the [MeasureScope.layout]
     * factory, which takes the calculated size of this layout, its alignment lines, and a block
     * defining the positioning of the children layouts.
