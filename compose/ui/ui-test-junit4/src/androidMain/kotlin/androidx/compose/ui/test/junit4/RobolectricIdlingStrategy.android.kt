/**
 * Idling strategy for use with Robolectric.
 *
 * When running on Robolectric, the following things are different:
 * 1. IdlingResources are not queried. We drive Compose from the ComposeIdlingResource, so we
 * need to do that manually here.
 * 2. Draw passes don't happen. Compose performs most measure and layout passes during the draw
 * pass, so we need to manually trigger an actual measure/layout pass when needed.
 * 3. Awaiting idleness must happen on the main thread. On Espresso it's exactly the other way
 * around, so we need to invert our thread checks.
 *
 * Note that we explicitly don't install our [IdlingResourceRegistry] into Espresso even though
 * it would be a noop anyway: if at some point in the future they will be supported, our behavior
 * would silently change (potentially leading to breakages).
