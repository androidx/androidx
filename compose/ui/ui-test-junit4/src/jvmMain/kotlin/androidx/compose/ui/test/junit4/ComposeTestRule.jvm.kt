/**
 * A [TestRule] that allows you to test and control composables and applications using Compose.
 * Most of the functionality in this interface provides some form of test synchronization: the
 * test will block until the app or composable is idle, to ensure the tests are deterministic.
 *
 * For example, if you would perform a click on the center of the screen while a button is
 * animation from left to right over the screen, without synchronization the test would sometimes
 * click when the button is in the middle of the screen (button is clicked), and sometimes when
 * the button is past the middle of the screen (button is not clicked). With synchronization, the
 * app would not be idle until the animation is over, so the test will always click when the
 * button is past the middle of the screen (and not click it). If you actually do want to click
 * the button when it's in the middle of the animation, you can do so by controlling the
 * [clock][mainClock]. You'll have to disable [automatic advancing][MainTestClock.autoAdvance],
 * and manually advance the clock by the time necessary to position the button in the middle of
 * the screen.
 *
 * An instance of [ComposeTestRule] can be created with [createComposeRule], which will also
 * create a host for the compose content for you (see [ComposeContentTestRule]). If you need to
 * specify which particular Activity is started on Android, you can use [createAndroidComposeRule].
 *
 * If you don't want any Activity to be started automatically by the test rule on Android, you
 * can use [createEmptyComposeRule]. In such a case, you will have to set content using one of
 * Compose UI's setters (like [ComponentActivity.setContent][androidx.compose.ui.platform
 * .setContent]).
