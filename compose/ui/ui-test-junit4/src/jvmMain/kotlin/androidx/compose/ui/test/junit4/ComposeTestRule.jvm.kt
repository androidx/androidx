/**
 * A [TestRule] that allows you to test and control composables, either in isolation or in
 * applications. Most of the functionality in this interface provides some form of test
 * synchronization: the test will block until the app or composable is idle, to ensure the tests are
 * deterministic.
 *
 * For example, if you would perform a click on the center of the screen while a button is animating
 * from left to right over the screen, without synchronization the test would sometimes click when
 * the button is in the middle of the screen (button is clicked), and sometimes when the button is
 * past the middle of the screen (button is not clicked). With synchronization, the app would not be
 * idle until the animation is over, so the test will always click when the button is past the
 * middle of the screen (and not click it). If you actually do want to click the button when it's in
 * the middle of the animation, you can do so by controlling the [clock][mainClock]. You'll have to
 * disable [automatic advancing][MainTestClock.autoAdvance], and manually advance the clock by the
 * time necessary to position the button in the middle of the screen.
 *
 * An instance of [ComposeTestRule] can be created with [createComposeRule], which will also create
 * a host for the compose content for you (see [ComposeContentTestRule]). If you need to specify
 * which particular Activity is started on Android, you can use [createAndroidComposeRule].
 *
 * If you don't want any Activity to be started automatically by the test rule on Android, you can
 * use [createEmptyComposeRule]. In such a case, you will have to set content using one of Compose
 * UI's setters (like [ComponentActivity.setContent][androidx.compose.ui.platform .setContent]).
