/**
 * The receiver scope of the touch input injection lambda from [performTouchInput].
 *
 * The functions in [TouchInjectionScope] can roughly be divided into two groups: full gestures
 * and individual touch events. The individual touch events are: [down], [move] and friends, [up],
 * [cancel] and [advanceEventTime]. Full gestures are all the other functions, like
 * [click][TouchInjectionScope.click], [doubleClick][TouchInjectionScope.doubleClick],
 * [swipe][TouchInjectionScope.swipe], etc. These are built on top of the individual events and
 * serve as a good example on how you can build your own full gesture functions.
 *
 * A touch gesture is started with a [down] event, followed by a sequence of [move] events and
 * finally an [up] event, optionally combined with more sets of [down] and [up] events for
 * multi-touch gestures. Most methods accept a pointerId to specify which pointer (finger) the
 * event applies to. Movement can be expressed absolutely with [moveTo] and [updatePointerTo], or
 * relative to the current pointer position with [moveBy] and [updatePointerBy]. The `moveTo/By`
 * methods enqueue an event immediately, while the `updatePointerTo/By` methods don't. This
 * allows you to update the position of multiple pointers in a single [move] event for
 * multi-touch gestures. Touch gestures can be cancelled with [cancel]. All events, regardless
 * the method used, will always contain the current position of _all_ pointers.
 *
 * The entire event injection state is shared between all `perform.*Input` methods, meaning you
 * can continue an unfinished touch gesture in a subsequent invocation of [performTouchInput] or
 * [performMultiModalInput]. Note however that while the pointer positions are retained across
 * invocation of `perform.*Input` methods, they are always manipulated in the current node's
 * local coordinate system. That means that two subsequent invocations of [performTouchInput] on
 * different nodes will report a different [currentPosition], even though it is actually the same
 * position on the screen.
 *
 * All events sent by these methods are batched together and sent as a whole after
 * [performTouchInput] has executed its code block. Because gestures don't have to be defined all
 * in the same [performTouchInput] block, keep in mind that while the gesture is not complete,
 * all code you execute in between these blocks will be executed while imaginary fingers are
 * actively touching the screen. The events sent as part of the same batch will not be interrupted
 * by recomposition, however, if a gesture spans multiple [performTouchInput] blocks it is
 * important to remember that recomposition, layout and drawing could take place during the
 * gesture, which may lead to events being injected into a moving target. As pointer positions are
 * manipulated in the current node's local coordinate system, this could lead to issues caused by
 * the fact that part of the gesture will take effect before the rest of the events have been
 * enqueued.
 *
 * Example of performing a click:
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.test.samples.touchInputClick
 *
 * Example of performing a swipe up:
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.test.samples.touchInputSwipeUp
 *
 * Example of performing an L-shaped gesture:
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.test.samples.touchInputLShapedGesture

/**
 * Performs a swipe gesture on the associated node such that it ends with the given [endVelocity].
 *
 * The swipe will go through [start] at t=0 and through [end] at t=[durationMillis]. In between,
 * the swipe will go monotonically from [start] and [end], but not strictly. Due to imprecision,
 * no guarantees can be made for the actual velocity at the end of the gesture, but generally it
 * is within 0.1 of the desired velocity.
 *
 * When a swipe cannot be created that results in the desired velocity (because the input is too
 * restrictive), an exception will be thrown with suggestions to fix the input.
 *
 * The coordinates are in the node's local coordinate system, where (0, 0) is the top left corner
 * of the node. The default duration is calculated such that a feasible swipe can be created that
 * ends in the given velocity.
 *
 * @param start The start position of the gesture, in the node's local coordinate system
 * @param end The end position of the gesture, in the node's local coordinate system
 * @param endVelocity The velocity of the gesture at the moment it ends in px/second. Must be
 * positive.
 * @param durationMillis The duration of the gesture in milliseconds. Must be long enough that at
 * least 3 input events are generated, which happens with a duration of 40ms or more. If omitted,
 * a duration is calculated such that a valid swipe with velocity can be created.
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException When no swipe can be generated that will result in the desired
 * velocity. The error message will suggest changes to the input parameters such that a swipe
 * will become feasible.
