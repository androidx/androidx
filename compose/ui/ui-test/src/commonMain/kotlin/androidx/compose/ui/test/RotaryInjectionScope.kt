/**
 * The receiver scope of rotary input injection lambda from [performRotaryScrollInput].
 *
 * A rotary event can be sent with [rotateToScrollVertically] or [rotateToScrollHorizontally].
 * All events sent by these methods are batched together and sent as a whole after
 * [performRotaryScrollInput] has executed its code block.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * onRoot().performRotaryScrollInput {
 *     rotateToScrollVertically(3.0f)
 * }
 *
 * onRoot().performRotaryScrollInput {
 *     rotateToScrollVertically(3.0f)
 *     rotateToScrollVertically(10.0f)
 *     rotateToScrollVertically(2.0f)
 * }
