/**
 * The receiver scope of the multi-modal input injection lambda from [performMultiModalInput].
 *
 * [MultiModalInjectionScope] brings together the receiver scopes of all individual modalities,
 * allowing you to inject gestures that consist of events from different modalities, like touch
 * and mouse. For each modality, there is a function to which you pass a lambda in which you can
 * inject events for that modality: currently, we have [touch], [mouse] and [key] functions.
 * See their respective docs for more information.
 *
 * Note that all events generated by the gesture methods are batched together and sent as a whole
 * after [performMultiModalInput] has executed its code block.
 *
 * Example of performing a click via touch input followed by drag and drop via mouse input:
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.test.samples.multiModalInputClickDragDrop
 *
 * @see InjectionScope
 * @see TouchInjectionScope
 * @see MouseInjectionScope
 * @see KeyInjectionScope
 * @see RotaryInjectionScope
