 * When soft wrap is enabled and the width of the text exceeds the width of its container,
 * line breaks are inserted in the text to split it over multiple lines.
 *
 * There are a number of parameters that affect how the line breaks are inserted.
 * For example, the breaking algorithm can be changed to one with improved readability
 * at the cost of speed.
 * Another example is the strictness, which in some languages determines which symbols can appear
 * at the start of a line.
