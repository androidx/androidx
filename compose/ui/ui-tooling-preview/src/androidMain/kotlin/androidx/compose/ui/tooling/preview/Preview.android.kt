/**
 * [Preview] can be applied to either of the following:
 * - @[Composable] methods with no parameters to show them in the Android Studio preview.
 * - Annotation classes, that could then be used to annotate @[Composable] methods or other
 * annotation classes, which will then be considered as indirectly annotated with that [Preview].
 *
 * The annotation contains a number of parameters that allow to define the way the @[Composable]
 * will be rendered within the preview.
 *
 * The passed parameters are only read by Studio when rendering the preview.
 *
 * @param name Display name of this preview allowing to identify it in the panel.
 * @param group Group name for this @[Preview]. This allows grouping them in the UI and display only
 * one or more of them.
 * @param apiLevel API level to be used when rendering the annotated @[Composable]
 * @param widthDp Max width in DP the annotated @[Composable] will be rendered in. Use this to
 * restrict the size of the rendering viewport.
 * @param heightDp Max height in DP the annotated @[Composable] will be rendered in. Use this to
 * restrict the size of the rendering viewport.
 * @param locale Current user preference for the locale, corresponding to
 * [locale](https://d.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html#LocaleQualifier) resource
 * qualifier. By default, the `default` folder will be used.
 * @param fontScale User preference for the scaling factor for fonts, relative to the base
 * density scaling.
 * @param showSystemUi If true, the status bar and action bar of the device will be displayed.
 * The @[Composable] will be render in the context of a full activity.
 * @param showBackground If true, the @[Composable] will use a default background color.
 * @param backgroundColor The 32-bit ARGB color int for the background or 0 if not set
 * @param uiMode Bit mask of the ui mode as per [android.content.res.Configuration.uiMode]
 * @param device Device string indicating the device to use in the preview. See the available
 * devices in [Devices].
 * @param wallpaper Integer defining which wallpaper from those available in Android Studio
 * to use for dynamic theming.
