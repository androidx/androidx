 * <p>To prevent the ViewPager2 itself from dispatching the insets incorrectly, this listener will
 * consume all insets it applies. As a consequence, siblings of ViewPager2, or siblings of its
 * parents, to whom the WindowInsets haven't yet been dispatched, won't receive them at all. If
 * you require those views to receive the WindowInsets, do not set this listener on ViewPager2
 * and do not consume insets in any of the pages.
 *
 * <p>Call {@link #install(ViewPager2)} to install this listener in ViewPager2.
 *
