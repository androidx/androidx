     * protocol:
     * - Static Lists: Direct arrays of component IDs.
     * - Dynamic Templates: An object defining a `componentId` and a data `path` (e.g., `{"path":

     * components themselves. The returned component references can be used to call

     * lazy observation of child states in lazy layouts like `LazyColumn`.
