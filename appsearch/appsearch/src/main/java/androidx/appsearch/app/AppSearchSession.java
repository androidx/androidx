     * Retrieves documents from the open {@link AppSearchSession} that match a given query string
     * and type of search provided.
     *
     * <p>Query strings can be empty, contain one term with no operators, or contain multiple
     * terms and operators.
     *
     * <p>For query strings that are empty, all documents that match the {@link SearchSpec} will be
     * returned.
     *
     * <p>For query strings with a single term and no operators, documents that match the
     * provided query string and {@link SearchSpec} will be returned.
     *
     * <p>The following operators are supported:
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li>AND (implicit)
     *     <p>AND is an operator that matches documents that contain <i>all</i>
     *     provided terms.
     *     <p><b>NOTE:</b> A space between terms is treated as an "AND" operator. Explicitly
     *     including "AND" in a query string will treat "AND" as a term, returning documents that
     *     also contain "AND".
     *     <p>Example: "apple AND banana" matches documents that contain the
     *     terms "apple", "and", "banana".
     *     <p>Example: "apple banana" matches documents that contain both "apple" and
     *     "banana".
     *     <p>Example: "apple banana cherry" matches documents that contain "apple", "banana", and
     *     "cherry".
     *
     *     <li>OR
     *     <p>OR is an operator that matches documents that contain <i>any</i> provided term.
     *     <p>Example: "apple OR banana" matches documents that contain either "apple" or "banana".
     *     <p>Example: "apple OR banana OR cherry" matches documents that contain any of
     *     "apple", "banana", or "cherry".
     *
     *     <li>Exclusion (-)
     *     <p>Exclusion (-) is an operator that matches documents that <i>do not</i> contain the
     *     provided term.
     *     <p>Example: "-apple" matches documents that do not contain "apple".
     *
     *     <li>Grouped Terms
     *     <p>For queries that require multiple operators and terms, terms can be grouped into
     *     subqueries. Subqueries are contained within an open "(" and close ")" parenthesis.
     *     <p>Example: "(donut OR bagel) (coffee OR tea)" matches documents that contain
     *     either "donut" or "bagel" and either "coffee" or "tea".
     *
     *     <li>Property Restricts
     *     <p>For queries that require a term to match a specific {@link AppSearchSchema}
     *     property of a document, a ":" must be included between the property name and the term.
     *     <p>Example: "subject:important" matches documents that contain the term "important" in
     *     the "subject" property.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Additional search specifications, such as filtering by {@link AppSearchSchema} type or
     * adding projection, can be set by calling the corresponding {@link SearchSpec.Builder} setter.
     *
     * <p>This method is lightweight. The heavy work will be done in
     * {@link SearchResults#getNextPageAsync}.
     *
     * @param queryExpression query string to search.
     * @param searchSpec      spec for setting document filters, adding projection, setting term
     *                        match type, etc.
