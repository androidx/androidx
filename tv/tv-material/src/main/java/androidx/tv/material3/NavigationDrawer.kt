 * Navigation drawers provide ergonomic access to destinations in an app.
 * Modal navigation drawers are good for infrequent, but more focused, switching to different

 *
 * It displays content associated with the closed state when the drawer is not in focus and displays
 * content associated with the open state when the drawer or its contents are focused on.
 * Modal navigation drawers are elevated above most of the app’s UI and don’t affect the screen’s
 * layout grid.
 *
 * Example:
 * @sample androidx.tv.samples.SampleModalNavigationDrawerWithSolidScrim
 * @sample androidx.tv.samples.SampleModalNavigationDrawerWithGradientScrim
 *
 * @param drawerContent Content that needs to be displayed on the drawer based on whether the drawer
 * is [DrawerValue.Open] or [DrawerValue.Closed].
 * Drawer-entries can be animated when the drawer moves from Closed to Open state and vice-versa.
 * For, e.g., the entry could show only an icon in the Closed state and slide in text to form
 * (icon + text) when in the Open state.
 *
 * To limit the width of the drawer in the open or closed state, wrap the content in a box with the
 * required width.
 *
 * @param modifier the [Modifier] to be applied to this drawer
 * @param drawerState state of the drawer
 * @param scrimBrush brush to paint the scrim that obscures content when the drawer is open
 * @param content content of the rest of the UI. The content extends to the edge of the container
 * under the modal navigation drawer. Focusable content that is not part of the background must have
 * start-padding sufficient to prevent it from being drawn under the drawer in the Closed state.
