/**
 * Returns a [LiveData] mapped from the input `this` `LiveData` by applying
 * [transform] to each value set on `this`.
 * <p>
 * The returned `LiveData` delegates to the most recent `LiveData` created by
 * [transform] with the most recent value set to `this`, without
 * changing the reference. In this way [transform] can change the 'backing'
 * `LiveData` transparently to any observer registered to the `LiveData` returned
 * by `switchMap()`.
 *
 * Note that when the backing `LiveData` is switched, no further values from the older
 * `LiveData` will be set to the output `LiveData`. In this way, the method is
 * analogous to [io.reactivex.Observable.switchMap].
 *
 * [transform] will be executed on the main thread.
 *
 * Here is an example class that holds a typed-in name of a user
 * `String` (such as from an `EditText`) in a [MutableLiveData] and
 * returns a `LiveData` containing a List of `User` objects for users that have
 * that name. It populates that `LiveData` by requerying a repository-pattern object
 * each time the typed name changes.
 * <p>
 * This `ViewModel` would permit the observing UI to update "live" as the user ID text
 * changes.
 *
 * ```
 * class UserViewModel: AndroidViewModel {
 *     val nameQueryLiveData : MutableLiveData<String> = ...
 *
 *     fun usersWithNameLiveData(): LiveData<List<String>> = nameQueryLiveData.switchMap {
 *         name -> myDataSource.usersWithNameLiveData(name)
 *     }
 *
 *     fun setNameQuery(val name: String) {
 *         this.nameQueryLiveData.value = name;
 *     }
