/**
 * ViewModel is a class that is responsible for preparing and managing the data for
 * an [Activity][androidx.activity.ComponentActivity] or a [Fragment][androidx.fragment.app.Fragment].
 * It also handles the communication of the Activity / Fragment with the rest of the application
 * (e.g. calling the business logic classes).
 *
 * A ViewModel is always created in association with a scope (a fragment or an activity) and will
 * be retained as long as the scope is alive. E.g. if it is an Activity, until it is finished.
 *
 * In other words, this means that a ViewModel will not be destroyed if its owner is destroyed for a
 * configuration change (e.g. rotation). The new owner instance just re-connects to the existing
 * model.
 *
 * The purpose of the ViewModel is to acquire and keep the information that is necessary for an
 * Activity or a Fragment. The Activity or the Fragment should be able to observe changes in the
 * ViewModel. ViewModels usually expose this information via [Lifecycle][androidx.lifecycle.LiveData] or
 * Android Data Binding. You can also use any observability construct from your favorite framework.
 *
 * ViewModel's only responsibility is to manage the data for the UI. It **should never** access
 * your view hierarchy or hold a reference back to the Activity or the Fragment.
 *
 * Typical usage from an Activity standpoint would be:
 *
 * ```
 * class UserActivity : ComponentActivity {
 *     private val viewModel by viewModels<UserViewModel>()
 *
 *     override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle) {
 *         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
 *         setContentView(R.layout.user_activity_layout)
 *         viewModel.user.observe(this) { user: User ->
 *             // update ui.
 *         }
 *         requireViewById(R.id.button).setOnClickListener {
 *             viewModel.doAction()
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ViewModel would be:
 *
 * ```
 * class UserViewModel : ViewModel {
 *     private val userLiveData = MutableLiveData<User>()
 *     val user: LiveData<User> get() = userLiveData
 *
 *     init {
 *         // trigger user load.
 *     }
 *
 *     fun doAction() {
 *         // depending on the action, do necessary business logic calls and update the
 *         // userLiveData.
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ViewModels can also be used as a communication layer between different Fragments of an Activity.
 * Each Fragment can acquire the ViewModel using the same key via their Activity. This allows
 * communication between Fragments in a de-coupled fashion such that they never need to talk to
 * the other Fragment directly.
 *
 * ```
 * class MyFragment : Fragment {
 *   val viewModel by activityViewModels<UserViewModel>()
 * }
 *```
