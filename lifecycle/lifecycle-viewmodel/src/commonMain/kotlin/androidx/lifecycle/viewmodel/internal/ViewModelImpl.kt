     * The associated resources will be [AutoCloseable.close] right before the [ViewModel.onCleared]

     *
     * The clearing order is:

     * 2. [closeables][AutoCloseable.close]
     * 3. [ViewModel.onCleared]

     * This avoids potential problems found in older versions of `ConcurrentHashMap`.
