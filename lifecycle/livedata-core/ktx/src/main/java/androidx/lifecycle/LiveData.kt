/**
 * Adds the given [onChanged] lambda as an observer within the lifespan of the given
 * [owner] and returns a reference to observer.
 * The events are dispatched on the main thread. If LiveData already has data
 * set, it will be delivered to the onChanged.
 *
 * The observer will only receive events if the owner is in [Lifecycle.State.STARTED]
 * or [Lifecycle.State.RESUMED] state (active).
 *
 * If the owner moves to the [Lifecycle.State.DESTROYED] state, the observer will
 * automatically be removed.
 *
 * When data changes while the [owner] is not active, it will not receive any updates.
 * If it becomes active again, it will receive the last available data automatically.
 *
 * LiveData keeps a strong reference to the observer and the owner as long as the
 * given LifecycleOwner is not destroyed. When it is destroyed, LiveData removes references to
 * the observer and the owner.
 *
 * If the given owner is already in [Lifecycle.State.DESTROYED] state, LiveData
 * ignores the call.
