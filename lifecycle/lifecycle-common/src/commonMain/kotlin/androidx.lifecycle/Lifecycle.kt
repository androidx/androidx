/**
 * Defines an object that has an Android Lifecycle. [Fragment][androidx.fragment.app.Fragment]
 * and [FragmentActivity][androidx.fragment.app.FragmentActivity] classes implement
 * [LifecycleOwner] interface which has the [ getLifecycle][LifecycleOwner.getLifecycle] method to access the Lifecycle. You can also implement [LifecycleOwner]
 * in your own classes.
 *
 * [Event.ON_CREATE], [Event.ON_START], [Event.ON_RESUME] events in this class
 * are dispatched **after** the [LifecycleOwner]'s related method returns.
 * [Event.ON_PAUSE], [Event.ON_STOP], [Event.ON_DESTROY] events in this class
 * are dispatched **before** the [LifecycleOwner]'s related method is called.
 * For instance, [Event.ON_START] will be dispatched after
 * [onStart][android.app.Activity.onStart] returns, [Event.ON_STOP] will be dispatched
 * before [onStop][android.app.Activity.onStop] is called.
 * This gives you certain guarantees on which state the owner is in.
 *
 * To observe lifecycle events call [.addObserver] passing an object
 * that implements either [DefaultLifecycleObserver] or [LifecycleEventObserver].
