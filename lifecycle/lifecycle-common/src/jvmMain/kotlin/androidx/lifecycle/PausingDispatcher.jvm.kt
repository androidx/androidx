/**
 * Runs the given [block] on a [CoroutineDispatcher] that executes the [block] on the main thread
 * and suspends the execution unless the [Lifecycle]'s state is at least [minState].
 *
 * If the [Lifecycle] moves to a lesser state while the [block] is running, the [block] will
 * be suspended until the [Lifecycle] reaches to a state greater or equal to [minState].
 *
 * Note that this won't effect any sub coroutine if they use a different [CoroutineDispatcher].
 * However, the [block] will not resume execution when the sub coroutine finishes unless the
 * [Lifecycle] is at least in [minState].
 *
 * If the [Lifecycle] is destroyed while the [block] is suspended, the [block] will be cancelled
 * which will also cancel any child coroutine launched inside the [block].
 *
 * If you have a `try finally` block in your code, the `finally` might run after the [Lifecycle]
 * moves outside the desired state. It is recommended to check the [Lifecycle.getCurrentState]
 * before accessing the UI. Similarly, if you have a `catch` statement that might catch
 * `CancellationException`, you should check the [Lifecycle.getCurrentState] before accessing the
 * UI. See the sample below for more details.

 *             // is not DESTROYED. If it is destroyed, this coroutine will be cancelled as well.
 *             // However, we CANNOT access Views here.
 *
