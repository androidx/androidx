/**
 * Creates a LiveData that has values collected from the origin [Flow].
 *
 * If the origin [Flow] is a [StateFlow], then the initial value will be populated
 * to the [LiveData]'s value field on the main thread.
 *
 * The upstream flow collection starts when the returned [LiveData] becomes active
 * ([LiveData.onActive]).
 * If the [LiveData] becomes inactive ([LiveData.onInactive]) while the flow has not completed,
 * the flow collection will be cancelled after [timeoutInMs] milliseconds unless the [LiveData]
 * becomes active again before that timeout (to gracefully handle cases like Activity rotation).
 *
 * After a cancellation, if the [LiveData] becomes active again, the upstream flow collection will
 * be re-executed.
 *
 * If the upstream flow completes successfully *or* is cancelled due to reasons other than
 * [LiveData] becoming inactive, it *will not* be re-collected even after [LiveData] goes through
 * active inactive cycle.
 *
 * If flow completes with an exception, then exception will be delivered to the
 * [CoroutineExceptionHandler][kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineExceptionHandler] of provided [context].
 * By default [EmptyCoroutineContext] is used to so an exception will be delivered to main's
 * thread [UncaughtExceptionHandler][Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler]. If your flow upstream is
 * expected to throw, you can use [catch operator][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.catch] on upstream flow
 * to emit a helpful error object.
 *
 * The [timeoutInMs] can be changed to fit different use cases better, for example increasing it
 * will give more time to flow to complete before being canceled and is good for finite flows
 * that are costly to restart. Otherwise if a flow is cheap to restart decreasing the [timeoutInMs]
 * value will allow to produce less values that aren't consumed by anything.
 *
 * @param context The CoroutineContext to collect the upstream flow in. Defaults to
 * [EmptyCoroutineContext] combined with
 * [Dispatchers.Main.immediate][kotlinx.coroutines.MainCoroutineDispatcher.immediate]
 * @param timeoutInMs The timeout in ms before cancelling the block if there are no active observers
 * ([LiveData.hasActiveObservers]. Defaults to [DEFAULT_TIMEOUT].
